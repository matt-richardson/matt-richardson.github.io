	<h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>

	<p class="intro">
		My name is Matt Richardson. I'm a software developer, DevOps evangalist, explorer, 
		photographer and occasional amateur sound engineer.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm passionate about helping people and organisations deliver faster, easier and 
		better, usually through	driving cultural change, but also via good tooling that 
		can help teams drive better behaviours.
	</p>
	<p>
		After founding the (still) successful company <a href="http://www.redgum.com.au">Redgum Technologies</a> in 1997, I've worked with and for 
		some pretty cool companies over the years, from 
		<a href="http://www.devopsguys.com">DevOpsGuys</a>,
		<a href="http://trainline.com">trainline.com</a>,
		<a href="http://www.bbcworldwide.com">BBC WorldWide</a>, 
		<a href="http://ubs.com">UBS</a>, <a href="http://www.rbs.com">RBS</a> and more.

		Originally from Melbourne, Australia, I now live with my wife and
		two children just outside of London.
