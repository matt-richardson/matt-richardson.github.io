<P>Walking through Liverpool Street Station this morning, I walked past a guy dressed up as a cigarette, in a big cage, growling at people as they walked past...</P>
 <P>It was just a Nicorette promotion, but nonetheless, it&nbsp;put a big smile on my face. And, I s'pose, it's made my think about it, and talk about it, so its worked. The other guy, handing out brochures (or freebies, not sure which), was doing a brisk business as well.</P>
 <P>Definitely a good way to start the day <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
