<P><FONT face=Arial>Just thinking that i should put down roughly what my plans are for the next few weeks, as i start my life as an unemployed bum, and wander the world, until i get bored, and the money runs out...</FONT></P>
 <P><FONT face=Arial>Anyway:</FONT></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Tuesday 17th August, 12.15am - fly out of Melbourne</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Tuesday 17th August, 6am-ish - arrive KL, bum around for a few days, check out the city... (I've always thought it stupid to have a stop-over somewhere, and just sit in the airport - you're in the country, so why not check it out...</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Thursday 19th August, 12pm-ish - fly KL to London</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Thursday 19th August, 6pm-ish - arrive london, heathrow... yay!</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Friday - recuperate, while sponging of my buddies, Paul and Lydia...</FONT></LI></UL><P><FONT face=Arial>After that:</FONT></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Celebrate my birthday (the 24th of August)&nbsp;in another country <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif"></FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Head up to Glasgow at the start of sept, and get the proper tour of the place with my buddy Lindsay</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Head over to Italy around mid sept, and bum around Tuscany with Matt - then head north towards Amsterdam, where Matts got a 'business meeting' - or so he says...</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>After that - who knows</FONT></LI></UL>
 <P><FONT face=Arial>Longer term:</FONT></P>
 <UL>
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Go sailing around the Mediterranean for a while (theres a few web sites that hook up boat owners, and people who are willing to work for nothing, so everyone wins...) So, a few months of that, ahhh... life will be hard...</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Check out a white Christmas... Always wanted one of them...</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Wander lots and lots and lots... Really got to improve that map of visited countries - its looking kinda bare at the moment.</FONT> 
 <UL>
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Russia is up there on the list of places to vist.</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>France - will probably hang out there for a while</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>Skiing in the Swiss Alps - ahh - life is going to be sooo hard...</FONT> 
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>And well - i'll see where i end up</FONT></LI></UL>
 <LI><FONT face=Arial>When the money finally runs out, i'll think about getting a job. Either that, or i'll start robbing banks. Not sure which one yet.</FONT></LI></UL>
