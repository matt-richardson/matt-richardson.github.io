<p>Some nice photos I found a while back: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/in_pictures_josef_hoflehner___landscape_photographs/html/1.stm" title="Amazing Photos" mce_href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/07/in_pictures_josef_hoflehner___landscape_photographs/html/1.stm">Josef Hoflehner - Landscape 
 Photographs</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently he's got an exhibition on until 29 February at <a href="http://www.atlasgallery.com" mce_href="http://www.atlasgallery.com">Atlas Gallery</a>, Dorset Street, London.</p>
<p>Just have to find the time to get down there!</p>
