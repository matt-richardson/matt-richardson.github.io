<P>Well, I've arrived in England now, and i'm currently recuperating at Paul and Lyds house...</P>
 <P>I spent a few days in Kuala Lumpur, well, it was interesting, but not that exciting. A few things went wrong, which put a dint in the whole plan...</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>I booked into a hostel, so i could get the benefits of the hostel thang - common area to meet other travellers, and breakfast... However, the taxi driver couldn't find the hostel, and had never heard it. He dropped me near where the hostel was supposed to be, and i wandered up and down the street, trying to find it for a while (with a backpack on - not fun). No-one had ever heard of it. I went to the tourist information centre - they gave me a map, and circled where it was (completely different area to where the taxi driver had dropped me), so, i went up there. Still couldn't find it. After about 4 hours of trying to find this place, gave up, and went to a hotel. Only problem was, i was stuck by myself, and didn't have the breakfast. Oh, and had to pay a lot more than i would've at the backpackers. Not a good start to the whole travel thing. 
 <LI>Went to the Petronas towers - tallest towers in the world (i think), but they wouldn't let me go up them - they only had a limited number of tickets, and they'd already given them out. Doh. 
 <LI>The scales at the KL airport are very out. My bags weighed 36kg at melbourne (and the lady was nice enough not to charge me for it), but at KL, they weighed 41kg - and they wanted to charge me for the excess. Only $500 or so. Wasn't impressed. So, had to go and get some of it sent by unaccompanied baggage - still cost about $200. Not happy. At this point, was kinda regretting going to KL - it cost a lot more than i was planning. Also, means i have to go back out to Heathrow to pick up the bag later.</LI></UL>
 <P>Anyway, time for some good points about the whole KL thing. </P>
 <P>Umm... Well, it was hot and humid. Thats not a good thing though. Other than that, i went and visited the night market - lots of dodgy dvd's, t-shirts, watches, and shoes. Nothing that really grabbed me as exciting. I ate out at a street restaurant at the market - quite nice actually. I went up the second tallest tower in KL - couldn't go the tallest, so i went the second tallest <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif">. Got a few photos, but all-in-all, KL wasn't that exciting. Kinda interesting, but nothing exciting. i'll put a few photos up at some point soon.</P>
 <P>Oh, and saw a travel book on the trans-siberian railway - another one to add to the list of places i want to go... Four weeks travelling from Moscow to Vladivostok - could be very interesting. Just have to convince someone else it will be fun...</P>
 <P>Anyway, as i said earlier, i'm now in England, and we're just about to head into London - there's a show on at Trafalger Square. Not sure what it is, but it should be good. After that, we're going to head over and check out a west end show. Always wanted to do that.</P>
