<P>Made it safe back to London again - back at work again, getting back used to 'normal' life again.</P>
 <P>Finally got a full nights sleep last night - been sleeping really badly - damn jet lag, but, typical me, I'm not getting enough sleep anyway. Oh well, enough 'bout that.</P>
 <P>Didn't have the best of times in the US - wasn't quite the trip I was hoping for. Got a few pre-canned entries to post, and at least one more to write about it. Hopefully I'll actually do it soon, rather than leave it for too long (like I did with my France travel stories).</P>
 <P>Ummm... (elevator music play ssoftly in the background while Matt tries to remember what else he was going to write...)</P>
 <P>Currently living with Andrea and Mark - at least while I get organised to find a new place. Maybe i'm looking in the wrong city if I want to find something new inside and out, but in a decent area, at adecent price... Hmmm... Have been told that the docklands aint so good, but a few people have told me that Islington is good, so is Borough and London Bridge. i'll keep looking...</P>
 <P>Got about 5 GB of photos from the two months I was away - just gotta sort through them now - not very exciting. They're half sorted into location, but just need to rotate the portrait ones/delete the dodgy blurred ones/finish organising them, then figure out the best ones and upload them. I really don&#8217;t think anyone is gonna wanna look at several thousand photos...</P>
 <P>Off to Rotterdam this weekend - Margo is heading to Aus/NZ for a year or so, and having a bit of a leaving do - should be fun, but not sure if I really wanna go climb on a plane again so soon.</P>
 <P>That&#8217;s what I like about life in london... Invited out for a pub lunch (mmmm roast) on sunday, work drinks for someones birthday on monday night, lunch for someones birthday on tuesday, meeting up with some friends on thursday night, off to Rotterdam on friday night, next week a few things on, and next weekend i've got a couple of things as well... I like it <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>Anyway, enough rambling...</P>
 <P>ps - by civilisation,&nbsp;I mean 'not America'...<BR></P>
