<P>Now, heres a question thats got absolutely nothing to do with travelling... But, then again, maybe it does, in a zen like fashion. (Or is it a more Ghandi fashion???)</P>
 <P>Anywaaaaay, just curious what people (if anyone actually reads this blog...) think about how long these entries are?  Doyou think i'm writing too much, and i should cut down on the rambles, or should i just keep spouting, and write whatever i want to? </P>
 <P>I'm not entirely sure if I'm going to listen to you, cos i think i'm sort of using this as a diary for my own personal use anyway. Then again, i s'pose, i'm going to write it anyway, cos i know at least some of the family is reading it, and they'll read it no matter what i spout <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif">.</P>
 <P>Anyway, leave a comment, and let me know, now that i've at least got some stuff up here.</P>
