<P>I definitely would have preferred to spend more time in Austria - only got to visit one city there - Innsbruck, and only for two days. Then again, Matt had been through there before, and had seen it all, so i can understand him not wanting to visit all the places again.</P>
 <P>Innsbruck is stuckin a valley, surrounded by some pretty damn tall mountains. Its quite pretty actually. But, before&nbsp;I get there, I should say something about the trip there - apparently, that section of railroad is one of the most beautiful in the world. It snakes through and around all these mountains throughthe Alps, so its quite easy to just stare out the window for long periods of time. Very very nice.</P>
 <P>Getting back to Innsbruck again - 'cos of the time of year, there was a lot of clouds around, pretty much obscuring the tops of the mountains - every now and then, you could get a glimpse of a mountain, but not an overall impression. From what&nbsp;I saw though, I'd definitely get intimidated by the mountains if&nbsp;I lived there (I could see myself going outside and yelling at them occasionally - telling them to go and&nbsp;intimidate some other poor smuck, and stop looking over&nbsp;my shoulder...). </P>
 <P>Anyway, getting back on track, there's a river running through the middle of the town that feeds straight from a glacier - had an odd milky green colour to it. Looked pretty darn cold too, but didn't want to test out that theory - i was quite happy just assuming that <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">. </P>
 <P>Tim, Matt and I wandered around for a while, and had a bit of a look at the place, and then decided to go up the cable car to the top of one of the mountains nearby. Not a cheap thing to do, but, dammit, it was fun <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">.&nbsp;Got to the top of this hill (after a train thing (a funicular i think), then two cable cars), and got to about 2.5 kays up. Where it was snowing! Yay! Matt and I went out and played in the snow for a while (and got cold and wet, but who cares), and generally had a ball. </P>
 <P>Back in the hostel, managed to meet some more random strangers, including an Aussie guy who was captaining a yacht round the Med (ahh, the life), and a french girl, who first laughed at how few words i knew, then congratulated me on my french accent for the ones i did know - so all hope is not lost <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">. But, had a good time, playing darts (seems to be a big thing there - the hostel had 6 darts machines - odd).</P>
 <P>Went to offload my photos, and when i eventually managed to find somewhere to do it, the guy didn't really know what he was doing. I was stuck in that horrible place where you know more than the guy does, but you dont want to be rude and tell him how to do his job. Gah! After a while, I just took over anyway - it was easier, and wanted to catch a train at some point. Showed him how to do a few things <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">.</P>
 <P>And then, it was onto the train, yet again, this time, heading into Germany.&nbsp;Five trains later, and about 6 hours, we arrived in &#220;berlingen.</P>
