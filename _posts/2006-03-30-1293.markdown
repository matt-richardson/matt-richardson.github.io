<P>I love the feeling that changing to daylight savings gives you. Makes you feel like you've got an extra hour or more in the day.</P>
 <P>Especially in England, where the sun goes down very early in winter, it makes you want to head home and hibernate.&nbsp;Give you an extra hour, and it feels great! Add that to the slowly lengthening day, and its even better. The sun is checking out at about 7.30 now - great!</P>
