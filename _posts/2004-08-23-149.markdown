<P>Okay. Now i've finally got organised, and I've got a bit more of an idea of what i'm going to be up to for the next&nbsp;few weeks.</P>
 <P>I've just booked a ticket from London to Edinburgh for the 25th, and organised a booking on the <A href="http://www.macbackpackers.com/macbackpackers/tours/jj.htm">MacBackpackers Jump-on Jump-off bus</A>, so i can wander around Scotland at leisure. I've also booked a ticket from Glasgow to Rome on September 11 <IMG class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-8.gif"> to meet up with Old Matt.</P>
 <P>After that, its onto the wandering through Italy (especially Tuscany) for a while...</P>
