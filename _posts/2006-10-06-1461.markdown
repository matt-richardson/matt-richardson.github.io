<P>Just before I left Melbourne, back in 2004, I had a bit of a family dinner, just to say bye to everyone.</P>
 <P>One of my younger cousins (Georgia, I think), said I had to take a photo of Platform 9 <SUP>3/4</SUP> at Kings Cross Station, as in the Harry Potter books and movies.</P>
 <P>So, a little late, but here it is:</P>
 <figure>
  <A href="/images/IMG_4118.jpg">
    <IMG alt="Platform 9 3/4 at Kings Cross Station" src="/images/IMG_4118_small.jpg" border=0>
  </A>
</figure>
<figure>
  <A href="/images/IMG_4122.jpg" alt="Nearly through!">
    <IMG src="/images/IMG_4122_small.jpg" border=0>
  </A>
</figure>
 <P>And yes, I felt like an idiot posing for that one... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
