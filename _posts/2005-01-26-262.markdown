<P><EM>[Edit: Added a link to the dodgy spreadsheet thingy, cos some whingers (okay, one whinger) complained.]</EM></P>
 <P>Thanks to a <A href="http:/mjrichardson.com/blogcontent/Ageing113.xls">dodgy spreadsheet thingy</A> that my good old buddy Simone sent me, I just realised that I'm10,017 days old. That means I just missed&nbsp;my 10,000th day. Damn,&nbsp;I should've been out celebrating.</P>
 <P>Well, happy 10,000th day to me anyway <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
