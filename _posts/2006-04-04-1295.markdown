<P>Funny how slack sales assistants (checkout chicks) are in the UK. Most of the time they've got chairs, don't even bother greeting you, and almost never put stuff in bags for you. They'll sit there and wait (looking extremely bored) while you pack your own stuff into bags, not even serving the next customer.</P>
 <P>The thing is, no-one seems to think this is a bad thing. Back when I was a checkout chick, we'd have been shot if we treated our customers that badly...</P>
 <P>(Rant over... Now back to our regular scheduled programming...) <BR></P>
