<P>Just found out (okay, it was yesterday that I found out, but I forgot to post about it), that Andrea had heard back from the doctors...</P>
 <P>Now, to backpedal a bit, Andrea and Mark went on a skiing holiday last week, over in France (I think). First of all, Andrea didn't really enjoy it too much, and was considering coming home early. But, she got more into it, and started enjoying herself. Andrew got a msg about midweek saying that she was enjoying herself, and just about to go down one of the slightly harder runs. A few hours later, there was another text message saying that she'd had a fun ride on a snow mobile to the doctors, and was now wearing a neck brace...</P>
 <P>So, she's just heard back about what was actually wrong. She's fractured one of the vertebrae in her neck, which apparently means she'd officially broken her neck. Now she's got 3 weeks off to recover.</P>
 <P>Freaky. Scary. But she's alright, so that&#8217;s good. But, breaking your neck 6 months before your wedding is a bit of poor planning...</P>
 <P>Now, I'm just wondering how long it will take before it comes out that Mark pushed her... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
