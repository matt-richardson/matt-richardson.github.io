<P>Its a bit belated, but, hey, better late than never... So:</P>
 <P>Merry Christmas everyone <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Hope you all have a great day, and Santa brings you all the presents that you wanted <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Take care, have a great new years, and a really really great year to come.</P>
 <P>PS. Hope that those of you heading up north (in England at least) get a white Christmas - from what I've heard, its not looking so good for those London-folk...</P>
