<P>Just a short one to let you know that I've finally got all of my photos uploaded from the last batch of travelling.</P>
 <P>Be warned - there's <STRONG>lots</STRONG> of them. And I mean <STRONG>lots</STRONG>. I mean, like a 175 photos of and from the Eiffel tower (I got all arty, and all excited about how industrial and mechanical it was, and couldn't help myself). There's also lots of photos from Santorini - that was another place that I couldn't take a step without seeing something new and exciting that i just had to photograph.</P>
 <P>But, there's some pretty cool ones in there. Go check 'em out.</P>
