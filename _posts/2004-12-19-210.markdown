<P>Howdy all.</P>
 <P>Seeing its approaching Christmas, and the whole New Year thing, and seeing that I'm too slack to actually send individual emails, or heaven forbid, actually send cards, I'm going to do it all from here.</P>
 <P>So, I wish you all an amazing Christmas, and a New Year that surpasses all expactations.</P>
 <P>Its definitely been an interesting year, and for lots of people, some pretty weird and <EM>(interesting/crazy/bad/insert appropriate word here)</EM> stuff has gone down. Life has changed in lots of ways for a lot of us, but then again, for some, it hasn't changed enough. So, based on that, I hope that the&nbsp;new year brings you a much brighter year, where things are a heck of a lot less confusing, and a great deal more enjoyable.</P>
 <P>Its been interesting being over on the other side of the world. It really helps you to realise what you have back home. So, to all those back home, I do miss you, and I definitely appreciate the thoughts/emails/phone calls/whatevers that you've sent my way. Its going to be an odd Christmas being over here, away from the family and friends. But, I've got some good friends here, so its not going to be too bad.</P>
 <P>Anyway, my apologies for the deep and kinda soppy content of this post - I shall have myself taken down to the back field and shot immediately <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>But, just to reiterate - have a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. And, as always, keep flying.</P>
 <P>Matt</P>
