<P>Just looking through the referrers on my blog (the list of people who visited my site, via a link (ie, via google or something)), and found that someone had searched for <A href="http://www.google.com/search?q=kyleakin+hostel+matt">kyleakin + hostel&nbsp;+ matt</A>, and which had come back with my blog as the 4th entry.</P>
 <P>Spent a bit of time trying to remember who I met in that hostel, then&nbsp;I realised that&nbsp;as they didn't leave me a note,&nbsp;it probably&nbsp;it wasn't me they were trying to find. But, cool anyway <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
