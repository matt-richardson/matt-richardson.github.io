<P>If you go to your home town, you're not going to do any of the touristy things, as you already know your town, so that knocks out a lot of the daytime activities.</P>
 <P>Then, all the people you know there are stuck in the normal rut of life (yoga on Tuesday nights, netball on Thursday nights, roast on Sunday nights, etc, and their calendars are booked up months in advance), so trying to fit in with their schedules is hard.</P>
 <P>And when you do catch up with them, there's nothing really exciting thats happened that can answer the question &#8220;so, what have you been up to in the last six months?&#8221;. I mean, you could see them once a week, and you could talk for ages about the little stuff, like the nice restaurant you went to last weekend, and so on, but nothing thats worth talking about on a slightly longer timescale.</P>
 <P>Oh, and staying with your parents is also not a good idea. Makes you remember why you moved out originally. Or start looking for the shovel.</P>
 <P>Yep,&nbsp;I'm not really enjoying this trip. Is it that obvious?</P>
