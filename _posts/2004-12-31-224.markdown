<P>Just recently my laptop has been a bit odd, and blue-screened a few times on me.</P>
 <P>Today, I found out why. When I turned it on this morning, it popped up with &#8220;SMART Disk Drive: Imminent Disk Failure&#8221;. That explains why it hasn't been too happy lately. At least its telling me that its about to happen, not that it has happened. I can get all my important stuff of it now.</P>
 <P>I just get the fun of reinstalling everything. Yay. </P>
