After an, ahem, small hiatus, the blog is back.

To be fair, I've been attempting to get it back for quite a while now, which is a bit of a challenge with a toddler and a 3 month old causing havok left right and centre.

All sorts of pain involved in getting it back to life - corrupt databases (I submitted a patch to the [website panel](http://wspdev.virtuworks.com:81/issue/wsp-10190) project to fix that), missing images, dodgy hosting environments and more.

Its all hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) now, so its all lightening fast and should work a lot better.

Still need to get the comments imported - it half worked but not quite enough. Need to get some content up that I'm being hassled about before I focus too much on that.

Here's to a blog that actually has some useful content posted on a regular basis. It will probably focus more on tech - specifically in the DevOps space. 

Enjoy.
