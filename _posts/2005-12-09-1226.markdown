<P>(&#163;20 if you can tell me which book that comes from...)</P>
 <P>Anyway, all packed, and room emptied into various attics and garages, and really, if its not done by now, well, too bad.</P>
 <P>Few final things, and then I'm off to heathrow. 27 or so hours later, I'll be good ol' Melbourne. Yay! <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>To the house-mates: its been a blast, but time for a change. Never fear,&nbsp;I shall be dropping round for food occaisionally... (I'll leave that up to you to decide whether thats a good thing or not <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>).</P>
 <P>To those over this side of the world: see you in a couple of months.</P>
 <P>To those in Melbourne: see ya soon!</P>
 <P>Yay! <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0></P>
