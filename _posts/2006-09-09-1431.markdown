 Saw this one the other week, but didn't get around to posting it...</p>

 Racial profiling at its best... Scary. Those guys went through security. if the other people don't want to fly with them, it should be them who get off, not the ones accused. Or did we change to a mob rule, guilty till proven innocent model when I wasn't looking? I mean, how would those guys have felt? They'd probably have a great case for suing, I think.

 Just adds to the racial tensions between east and west. Not good.</p>
