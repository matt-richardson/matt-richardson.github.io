<p>While Paul &amp; Lyds were over here a few months back, we headed off to <a href="http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/">Shakespeare's Globe Theatre</a>, to see Othello. </p>
<p>I'd seen&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074gmy">"Shakespeare Code" episode of Doctor Who</a>, and thought that it was about time to get along there and check it out, seeing its a pretty damn amazing venue.</p>

<p>Was well worth going, and seeing theatre as they did in the days of old. Though, was definitely a good idea to hire some seat cushions, and probably would have been a good idea to hire the seat backs as well - hard work sitting for 3 hours on hard wooden benches... Though it would've been much worse for those standing.</p>

<p>Othello itself was hard work keeping up (seeing I didn't even know the storyline), but was done quite well.</p>
<p>All in all, was good - though it was very strange to be sitting in a place like that and looking out the roof (only the bays are covered) and seeing planes fly overhead...</p>
