<P><A href="http://www.1stcontact.co.uk">1st Contact</A> is a company that helps backpackers/visitors/whoever get setup when they head over to London. They've got a <A href="http://www.1stcontact.co.uk/live/index.php?&Category_ID=16&Item_ID=&Q">KickStart package</A>, which helps you get setup with a bank account (harder than it sounds), work out the banking system (why does the word archaic spring to mind?), sort out the employment situation, find housing, and general stuff like that. They can also put you in touch with recruitment agencies - some of whom can give you a job starting the next day (if you dont mind retail). </P>
 <P>They're very helpful, and make life lots easier for those who've just arrived and want to find out how to get things done. If I'd done it when I first got here, it would've made my life a lot easier. As it was, it wasn't too hard, as <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/paulsblog">Paul and Lyds</A> told me almost everything I needed. But it was quite fun seeing the slide show of pictures at the end of the talk, and saying &#8220;been there, been there, been there too&#8220;... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>They also give you lots of vouchers and stuff like that for tourist sites and a free phone card, and a voucher for the pub - just to get you in the London swing of things.</P>
 <P>So, the long and short of it - those of you who are heading over this way to do the work/live in London thing, go and get one of the KickStart packages. Get in from Oz, cos its cheaper there than here.</P>
