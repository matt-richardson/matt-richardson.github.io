<p>Headed up to the good ol' Edinburgh Fringe this weekend with <a href="http://www.getjealous.com/ldileonardo">Luch</a> - was great!</p>
<p>Ended up seeing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=3932"><strong>An AirBalloon Across Antarctica</strong></a></p>
<p>This was the play that Charlie and <a href="http://www.threetoaroom.com/">her theatre company</a> put on. Slightly mad, but definitely very good. Apparently they're getting offers to go traveling with it, so its going really well. Definitely worth seeing...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=5774"><strong>Josie Long</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;- Trying is Good</strong></p>
<p>An amusing hour, not brilliant, but fairly good. Best bit of it was that she's allergicto wheat (well, that bit sucks), and she managed to find a really really nice rye bread, made by the strangely named "<a href="http://www.knoxbusinessdirect.com.au/Emem/Pub/EMemProfile.asp?lngMemID=-729000671">Alex's Wupertaler &amp; Rye Bakery</a>".&nbsp;Apparently, its only available in Melbourne, which sucks, but then again, it will be good when I eventually get back there. (Oh, and to clarify, rye bread usually tastes pretty horrible, so puts a dint in avoiding the whole wheat thing...)</p>
<p>A pic (of a pic) from one of the fringe mags&nbsp;(mainly as a prompt to my memory in the future): </p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=4866"><strong>Jerry Sadowitz</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;- Comedian, Magician, Psychopath</strong></p>
<p>One of those comedians whose 'appeal' is the fact that every second word is a swear word. I can handle swearing, but if that's they're main appeal, well, it sucks. Did some quite clever magic tricks, and had the occasional good joke/comment/whatever, but generally, a waste of time and money.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=5355"><strong>Potted Potter</strong></a><strong>: The Unauthorised Harry Experience - A Parody by Dan and Jeff</strong></p>
<p>Very funny - all 6 books, plus a book 7 teaser, in an hour. Mad, funny, and good. Even included&nbsp;a quidditch match! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=5274"><strong>The Oxford Imps</strong></a></p>
<p>Improvisation troupe. Fairly good, but not brilliant.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=5763"><strong>Tripod</strong></a></p>
<p>The old favourite musical comedy trio from Melbourne... Funny but not as good as some of their previous material.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edfringe.com/shows/detail.php?action=shows&amp;id=5114"><strong>Meow Meow</strong></a><strong> in Beyond Glamour: The Absinthe Tour</strong></p>
<p>A very mad burlesque/cabaret/performance art thing... Only managed to get tickets by buying them off some random guy who couldn't make it. Probably the best show I saw. She ended up singing some of the songs in french, and got some random guy who knew a bit of french to translate - rather unsuccessfully, but very amusingly... Definitely worth seeing...</p>
<p>Also ended up going out quite late on the Friday, and to a mates place for a burlesque party on the Saturday. Some interesting pictures from that, but here's me trying to look suave and failing:</p>

<p>And yes, that is a pole dancing pole in the background.... [:)]</p>
<p>But, all in all, had a great time, even though it rained almost continuously on Saturday, and wasn't a lot of fun. Didn't get to catch up with Charlie properly - in between her performing and flyering, and me catching as many shows as&nbsp;I could, it didn't quite work out as well as I wanted... But managed to have a few beers with Greg, and caught up on stuff there.</p>
<p>Now, just gotta make sure I organise the fringe a heck of a lot earlier next time, and get a place in town... Possibly even move up in the world and don't do the hostel thing - the <a href="http://www.globetrotterinns.com/english/index.php">globetrotter</a> was a bit crap, really. </p>
<p>But, all in all, definitely a good weekend, and definitely gonna go again next year!</p>
