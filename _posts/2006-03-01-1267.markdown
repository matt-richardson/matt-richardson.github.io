<P>Here's (a slightly cleaned up version of) some notes&nbsp;I made about strange things&nbsp;I noticed along the way:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Cars have no rear indicator - the taillight flashes (red)</LI>
 <LI>You can legally turn right on a red light</LI>
 <LI>The cars are huge! (I thought Toorak Tractorswere bad...)</LI>
 <LI>Fuel costs about $2.30 or so per gallon</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI>US is 34p a litre</LI>
 <LI>Aus is 52p a litre</LI>
 <LI>UK is 90p a litre</LI>
 <LI>(sorry -&nbsp;I work in pounds now <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>)</LI></UL>
 <LI>There's lots of homeless people and beggars - they're everywhere. Quite disturbing for this "bastion of democracy"...</LI>
 <LI>The toilets use lots of water - 6 litres per flush. They have a&nbsp;different design where you&nbsp;can definitely see the swirl (which kinda explains why they care so much about whether southern hemisphere toilets swirl the other way), and most have no half flush.</LI>
 <LI>Its almost impossible to get news of the outside world - there's one&nbsp;page in the USA Today newspaper (the major national newspaper) - all focusing on Iraq and&nbsp;Afghanistan etc (they missed the <A href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4678368.stm">1100 people that died in the ferry disaster in Egypt</A>). No international news on telly, but there's&nbsp;three channels of college basketball though.</LI>
 <LI>A&nbsp;lot of hotels have free wifi - yay!</LI>
 <LI>Very little milk, but lots of coffee creamer - erk!</LI>
 <LI>Macdonald's sizing was very scary - medium is the same as large everywhere else in the world (which begs the question of how big did super-size used to be?)</LI>
 <LI>Sir and Ma'am is very common - strange.</LI>
 <LI>Freedom Ave, Freedom Plaza, Constitution Ave, Liberty Ave, etc,etc,etc&nbsp; - very patriotic country (one could almost read it as propaganda...)</LI>
 <LI>The rye bread has wheat in it! Here I am trying to avoid wheat, so i can enjoy my holiday without migraines, but the best bread i could come up with was corn tortillas.</LI>
 <LI>Its an extremely paranoid country - I lost yet another pocket knife while going out to the statue of liberty... What am i going to do with a blunt pocket knife, for crying out loud...</LI>
 <LI>The Empire State Building was&nbsp;excessively commercialised - took a lot of the excitement out of it.</LI></UL>
 <P>Anyway, hopefully it wont be too long before I get around to writing the last post(s) about the trip (then, I've got to get around to uploading photos... item 73 on my list... *sigh*)<BR></P>
