<P>... <A href="http://ned.ucam.org/~sdh31/misc/destroy.html">how to destroy the earth</A>.</P>
 <P>I mean, really. Properly. It lists all&nbsp;sorts of technically and scientifically accurate methods of destroying the earth. From being sucked into a microscopic black hole, to it getting hurled into the sun to it being gobbled up by stranglets (whatever they are) - its all listed, along with how feasible each method is.</P>
 <P>It even gives you some general geocide strategy tips to help out in your planning.</P>
 <P>There's even a &#8220;current earth destruction status&#8221;, from the &#8220;international earth-destruction advisory board&#8221;, which helpfully tells us:</P>
 <P><IMG alt="Current Earth-Destruction Status" src="http://ned.ucam.org/~sdh31/misc/geocide/current.png"> </P>
 <P>So, anyway, go read the site. Even if you aren't interested in destroying the earth - its a good laugh.</P>
