<P>Okey dokey... Time to babble on about Bacharach. I think we arrived there about the 1st of October, so I'm only 3 weeks behind on the posts... Gah! I'll get there soon, I hope.</P>
 <P>Anyway, once again, caught the train from A to B, A being Worms, B being Bacharach (or is it supposed to be W to B?). Oh yeah, thats something I should share about German trains - there's a ticket you can get for about &#8364;22 that allows up to 5 people to travel anywhere within the state, or on the weekend, allows you to travel anywhere in Germany! Much cheaper than the standard tickets. Has to be off-peak of course, but who really wants to travel peak, anyway?</P>
 <P>We also got to stay in a castle, <A href="http://www.bacharach.mittelrhein.net/rhein/burgen-burg-stahleck/">Burg Stahleck</A>, which has been completely refurbished, so its really nice inside - pretty much done up the way I'd like to do up an old house/building/castle. Still looks old on the outside, but really nice inside. Only problem with staying in a castle is that they're nearly always built at the top of hills. So, it was a pretty steep climb to get up there - with the pack on <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif">.

 <P>Good thing about Bacharach was that there was actually some other backpackers there, so it was a lot better. Spent a bit of time with one of the guys we met there - Ricardo - from the Dominican Republic, but living in Puerto Rico. He had been working for a week or so, and was talking some holidays before heading home again. Ended up hiring some bikes, and going for a ride - first downriver to <A href="http://www.burg-reichenstein.com/">Burg Reichenstein</A>, then up river (past Bacharach again) to St Goar, to <A href="http://www.burg-rheinfels.com/">Burg Rheinfels</A> - a pretty damn large castle, a bit ruined, but still pretty cool (except for the stinging nettles that i managed to find <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif">). Then again, after all the castles I've seen this year, I'm getting to the point of being almost castled-out. After that, we couldn't be bothered riding back, so we caught the ferry back downstream to home - very relaxing.</P>
