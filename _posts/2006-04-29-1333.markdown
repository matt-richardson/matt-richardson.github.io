<P>Seeing <A href="/blog/1303#1304">some people whinged</A>, I did a little jiggery-pokery-black-magic, and now there's a little hourglass when you expand the treeview, and it loads the&nbsp;menu items&nbsp;in the navigation panel. You know, that thing on the left. Go on, try it. I promise you'll like it. Maybe. Okay, you'll be seriously underwhelmed, but hey, I like it.</P>
