<p>Even though <a href="/blog/1416">I promised to try not to kill it</a>, i did. I did try to keep it alive,&nbsp;I watered it and everything!</p> <p>But, here is the end result:</p> <figure><img height="336" src="/images/ItriedHonestIdid_C769/deadplant.jpg" width="338"></figure> <p>Boo. Maybe&nbsp;I dont have&nbsp;green fingers&nbsp;after all*. Maybe&nbsp;living in a 6th&nbsp;floor apartment with no balcony isn't so good for plants.</p> <p>Binned :(</p> <p><em>* If you&nbsp;<strong>had</strong>&nbsp;green fingers,&nbsp;wouldn't it be a good time to get down to the doctors?</em></p>
