<!-- more -->

<P>Just spent a bit of time updating <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com">www.oneroundpebble.com</A>&nbsp;today. Now the navigation bar on the left should be a lot quicker to load, as it now dynamically loads the child nodes. Hopefully it also works on more people's computers.</P>
 <P>Had to fight a bit with various asp.net 2.0 configuration bits to get it all working properly, and various other fun stuff, but it all seems to work now.</P>
 <P>If anythings broken, let me know!&nbsp;<BR></P>
