<P>Just arrived back from <A href="http://www.backpackertours.co.uk/britain_uk_england_tours/oktoberfest_opening_tour.htm">Oktoberfest</A> yesterday, and spent today recovering from exchaustion... There was a little bit of recovering-from-drinking-so-much, but mainly exhaustion from such a long bus trip. Anyway, should start from the start, especially seeing that a few things have happened since&nbsp;I last blogged about&nbsp;what I've been up to.</P>
 <P>I think the last thing that I did blog about was Belgium. Getting back from Belgium, <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/">Biscuit</A> and I headed up to Edinburgh for the <A href="http://www.edfringe.com/">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</A>, and also the <A href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">Military Tattoo</A>. Also met up with <A href="http://oneroundpebble.com/paulsblog">Paul and Lydia</A> while we were there, as they got to the end of their four month trip. Had a good time there, managed to see quite a few shows, including:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI><A href="http://www.oninvisiblewings.com/bsg/black_sea_01.html">Mikelangelo and the Black Sea Gentlemen</A>&nbsp;- very odd, but very cool. 
 <LI><A href="http://www.assemblyrooms.com/programme2005/prog_code/TAOMA/programme_item.php">Tao - Martial Art of the Drum</A> - cool drumming dudes and chicks from japan 
 <LI><A href="http://www.gamarjobat.com/en/index.html">Gamajobat</A> - &#8220;a shut up comedy from Japan&#8221; - Japanese mime artists - very cool and very funny. 
 <LI><A href="http://www.chortle.co.uk/edfest2005/edshows.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.chortle.co.uk/edfest2005/stephenkamos.html">Stephen K Amos</A> - &#8220;100 Greatest Things Ever&#8220; - pretty funny 
 <LI><A href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/reviews.cfm?id=1842232005&amp;genre=Comedy">Paul Merton's Impro Chums</A> - very funny improvised comedy by very talented guys 
 <LI>and quite a few others...</LI></UL>
 <P>All in all, had a good time there. Didn't see anything super funny, but it was a good time all up. Also a nice relaxed time - got a good chance to kick back and relax and not do anything. Very enjoyable.</P>
 <P>Come to think of it, I also went and saw the Military Tattoo. Was good to see, but it was more gimmicky than I was expecting. It had a lot of military marching bands, and stuff like that, but it also had some kids on motorbikes and a demo by the SAS. The kids on motorbikes were pretty cool - they were doing cross-overs and the like, and I think at one point they had 15 kids on 5 bikes. Pretty clever - all done by kids about 8 years old. Also some done by teenagers - one of which managed to jump two cars successfully, but managed to fall over doing a wheelie... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.&nbsp;The SAS demo was also a bit gimmicky - it was a demo of them rescuing the crown jewels from thieves, but it really didn't look that good. But, other than that, the whole thing was quite good. Definitely enjoyed myself there. I've uploaded some photos from there - they're pretty crap, cos my old camera doesn't seem to take night photos very well. But, I've kept the best of them, and you can use your imagination to figure them out <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Come to think about it, I might leave the other things (Andrea &amp; Mark's wedding, Rob and Matt coming over, and Oktoberfest) for another entry - don't want you to get bored <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
