<P>Thought I'd check out <A href="http://www.zooomr.com/">Zooomr</A>, especially seeing they're giving away free Pro accounts to bloggers. All you have to do is sign up, upload a photo, and then link to it from your blog (as explained <A href="http://blog.zooomr.com/2006/07/07/do-we-love-bloggers-yes-we-do/">here</A>).</P>

 <P>So, if I can be bothered, I'll try and post (what i think is) a decent photo every couple of days. Then again, seeing how crazy my life has been lately, that might be every couple of weeks... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
