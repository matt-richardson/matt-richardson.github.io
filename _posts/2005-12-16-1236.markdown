<P>Yay! After 6 days, I've finally got my luggage with me...</P>
 <P>(At least,&nbsp;I think its my luggage... (hang on a sec - I'll go check... Yep, it is... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>))</P>
 <P>Now, finally, I can get changed... Phew -&nbsp;I think I was beginning to smell a bit. Hope nobody noticed <IMG alt=:~ class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-7.gif" border=0>.</P>
