<P><A href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</A> wrote an excellent piece on why <A href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html">Hiring is Obsolete</A>&nbsp;(all about why undergrads should go start a company). </P>
 <P>Always nice when someone tells you:</P>

 <P>Even if your startup does tank, you won't harm your prospects with employers. To make sure I asked some friends who work for big companies. I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft how they'd feel about two candidates, both 24, withequal ability, one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked, and another who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at a big company. Every one responded that they'd prefer the guy who'd tried to start his own company. Zod Nazem, who's in charge of engineering at Yahoo, said: </P>

 <P>Not that <A href="http://www.redgum.com.au">Redgum</A> "tanked", but we always knew that it was going to be good for our resumes.</P>
 <P>On a slightly more serious note, I must say that starting a company really gave me a big headstart into the industry. It would've taken me 10 years or more to even get to the point that I got to in the 5 years or so that I was at Redgum. Admittedly, it was getting thrown in the deep end, but thats sometimes the best way to learn.</P>
