<P><STRONG>(Written about mid September...)</STRONG></P>
 <P>Okay, we're where we? I think I'd babbled my way up to the flight to Edinbrugh. And a wonderful flight it was too - especially when the captain tells us theres something wrong with the hydraulics, and we have to hang around a while. Luckily it was only 15 minutes - unlike Andrew, who had to wait on the tarmac for over an hour...</P>
 <P>Stayed overnight in Edinburgh, managed to see a show at the comedy festival there (yay!), met up with Sammy - a friends (Bronwyn's)&nbsp; sister for a few drinks, then clambered on the jump-on jump-off bus (called the jojo bus by those in the know <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">) the next morning. So, managed to kick about Edinburgh for about 16 hours, all up. Definitely have to make the effort to get back for the comedy festival and do it properly - it pretty much stops the city, with shows on all the time.</P>
 <P>Had a lot of fun on the jojo bus - met a few mad people, especially the driver. Saw a few of the sights that there are to see, then stopped off at Edradour Distillery. Vaguely interesting tour, but the best bit was the cream liquer that we bought - very, very, very nice... Going to try and get some shipped down when I get organised. If you can get your hands on it, I highly recommend it.</P>
 <P>Managed to meet another Aussie (like that&#8217;s hard in the U.K. <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">) - a cop from Sydney called Krsti. We hung out with her for a few days, playing lots of games of 500, climbing a mountain, and generally having a ball. The mountain we climbed - Ben Vrackie, was the highest in the area, and by the time we got to the top (800 metres) or so, it was pretty cold, and very windy. Had to be careful when walking so as not to trip and get blown over. At one point, we were sitting in the lee of a rock, when a very friendly sheep materialise about 2 foor from Andrew's head - kinda scary. Then a few climbed on top of the rock we were leaning against, and was trying to imtimidate us from above. Even worse, one of the other sheep headbutted the other, and nearly pushed it over on top of us... Kinda fun :D</P>
 <P>Have had a lot of fun in the MacBackpackers hostels - the staff have all been completely bonkers, so I fitted in perfectly <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif"> I think within 5 minutes at each hostel, we'd been verbally abused by the staff (in a good way). Was fun <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif">.</P>
 <P>(Will come back and update these posts with photos when i actually get some photos online...)</P>
