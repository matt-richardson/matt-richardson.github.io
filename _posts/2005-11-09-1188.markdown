<P>Lately it seems that its been fireworks season round here... We've had <A href="http://www.reachgujarat.com/diwali.htm">Diwali</A>, <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr">Eid</A>, halloween, and <A href="http://www.bonefire.org/guy/">Guy Fawkes/Bonfire Night</A> (not sure what fireworks have had to do with&nbsp;halloween, but hey...).</P>
 <P>So, given that fireworks require a permit in Melbourne, its quite bizarre to see so many of them. Personally saw two stupid near accidents - one just out the front near home. Someone in the common opposite had sent a firework off at a very low angle, and it pretty much flew between the cars on the street, and exploded on the other footpath. Another time, heading home from the fireworks at Battersea Park, some idiot sent a firework shooting down the street, and it exploded in the middle of the intersection - about 5 metres away... Just a bit of a shock... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>That said, the fireworks at Battersea Park were quite good, but I'm still thinking that SkyShow 7, put on by Fox FM, way back at least 15 years ago, is still the best show I've seen. It went for&nbsp;a good few hours, and all the fireworks were in time with the music - was great! I'm guessing its also the last time i saw fireworks when i was still a kid, so its kind of understandable that its never been quite the same...</P>
 <P>I'll leave you with some pretty pics that&nbsp;I took at Battersea Park:</P>
