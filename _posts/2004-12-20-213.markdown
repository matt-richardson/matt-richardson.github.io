<P>Okay, for some reason at the pub last night, we got talking about that Fosters advert that they showed during the last Olympics. Just went looking for it, and couldn't find the video, but i managed to find a transcript of it, and a few interesting comments about it...</P>

 <P>A few things about this:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>We cant say that we &#8220;never start wars&#8220; anymore, after our lovely governments decision to invade Iraq.</LI>
 <LI><A href="http://www.effect.net.au/lukastan/humour/Alcohol/Fosters-Ad.htm">http://www.effect.net.au/lukastan/humour/Alcohol/Fosters-Ad.htm</A>&nbsp;has another version of it, which is definitely not PC, but fairly accurate <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></LI>
 <LI>Hmmm... would kill for a real hamburger <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></LI></UL>
 <P>As I was searching for a video version of this, I ran across a <A href="http://surveycentral.org/survey/6004.html">reference</A> to the <A href="/images/iamcanadian.mpeg">I Am Canadian</A> clip, which is fairly similar. It was on a survey site, with the text of the advert, and a question -&nbsp;&#8220;Is this anti-American?&#8220;. Very scary how many people said&nbsp;it was - over a third of the people responding. Gah.&nbsp;Next they'll decide that Canada is hiding weapons of mass destruction and decide to invade...</P>
