<P>Got it installed, and 90% setup. Seems quite good, smooth, and stable. Very pretty too...</P>
 <P>Only had&nbsp;three issues - it didn't want to setup while connected to my TV, and also that it seems that media centre shuts down when you connect to the machine by remote desktop:</P>

 <P>Really quite annoying, as it will kill any TV recordings you've got going if you connect to it at the wrong time.</P>
 <P>Last issue is that it seems to think that i've only got two speakers connected to it, when I've got it connected to a surround sound system... Oh well, I'm sure there's a way to make it work - just got to find it.</P>
 <P>Once I've got it sorted, I'll post a pretty picture to make you all jealous <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
