<P>A few weekends back, headed down to Kent, to <A href="http://www.nettlesteadplace.co.uk/weddings/">Nettlestead Place</A>, for <A href="http://thebrandwoods.blogspot.com/">Andrea &amp; Mark's</A> wedding.</P>
 <P>Was an amazingly beautiful venue, a country house set in beautiful gardens, and it was also a very nice ceremony. I've uploaded some photos of the day - taken with my new camera, so they're pretty good. Go check them out... Long and short of it is that I'm really happy for them both, and wish them all the best <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Matt and Rob - guys from <A href="http://www.redgum.com.au/">Redgum</A> and friends of Andrea - had also come over for the wedding, so it was really good to catch up with them too. Went out a few times - check out the photos for that as well - quite amusing <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.&nbsp; Rob is still around for a few more days - we're heading out tomorrow for his birthday - so much for Friday <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Hmmm... Really lost the motivation/ability to write too much more here... Maybe I should just stop for tonight, and save Oktoberfest for another time...</P>
