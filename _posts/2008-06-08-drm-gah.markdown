<p>Just ordered a pizza, and sat down to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey on HD-DVD (detailed version: the dvd in my laptop, and watching on my tv via hdmi cable).</p>
<p>Then just got a message saying:</p>
<figure>
    <a href="/images/image_2.png">
      <img title="image" height="139" alt="image" src="/images/image_thumb.png" width="442" border="0">
  </a>
</figure>
<p>So, there I am trying to watch a legitimate rented dvd (lovefilm.com is great btw!), and the DRM prevents me. </p>
<p>Gah. Why is downloading movies wrong again? At least I can watch them that way.</p>
<p>Okay, rant over.</p>
