    Warning - if you're not a nerd, dont bother reading any further. No, really, I mean it.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, related to some stuff i've been playing around with lately:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.talkingcallerid.com/ModemDriver.htm" mce_href="http://www.talkingcallerid.com/ModemDriver.htm">Modifying your modem driver file to support caller id</a> (and other 'unrecognised responses'). (Damn, this guy knows far too much about this, but very useful - kudos!)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.infinitec.de/libraries/exchange/default.aspx" mce_href="http://www.infinitec.de/libraries/exchange/default.aspx">Exchange WebDav .Net library</a>. Very nice library to query exchange via WebDav.
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
  See? Told you not to bother reading it. But thought I'd share the link love, cos these have come in quite useful lately.
