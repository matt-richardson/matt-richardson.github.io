<P>Back in the good old days, I used to absolutely love <A href="http://rdanderson.com/macgyver/macgyver.htm">McGyver</A>. Used to watch it every week, without fail.&nbsp;I used to watch it with as much regularity as my sister and mother used to watch <A href="http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/countrypract/countrypract.htm">A Country Practice</A>, or as much as they watch <A href="http://homeandaway.com.au/">Home and Away</A> or <A href="http://www.neighbours.com/">Neighbours</A>.</P>
 <P>However, the powers that be took away the good TV show, and left the crappy ones... Oh, well, thats life.</P>
 <P>But, I've just <A href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2005/05/31/423509.aspx">found out</A> that <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/series/-/89960/dvd/ref=pd_serl_dvd/102-8508719-0428148">McGyver is available on DVD</A>! Yay! Cool!</P>
 <P>Now, I've just got to figure out if I still think its as cool as it used to be... :)</P>
