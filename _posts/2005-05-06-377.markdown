<P>Chatting to Allison the other day, talking about the currency in Turkey. </P>
 <P>At the start of this year, they changed from Turkish Lira (TL) to New Turkish Lira (YTL). In doing so, they just chopped 6 zero's off the old currency's value. So, a can of coke used to cost about 1,000,000 TL. Now its worth 1YTL - much easier to handle. But the old currency is still valid, and in circulation.</P>
 <P>So, on this kind of thread, Allison piped up with:</P>
 <P>"'Who wants to be a millionaire' would've been crap in turkey.."</P>
 <P>Some people...</P>
