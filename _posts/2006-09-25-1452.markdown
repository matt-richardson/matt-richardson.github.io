<P>... I'm now back in London.</P>
 <P>Arrived back last Thursday from my 3 week backpacking jaunt round Eastern Europe. Ended up visiting:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Berlin, Germany</LI>
 <LI>Krakow, Poland</LI>
 <LI>Praha (Prague), Czech Republic</LI>
 <LI>Kutn&#225; Hora, Czech Republic</LI>
 <LI>Cesk&#253;Krumlov, Czech Republic</LI>
 <LI>Cesk&#233; Budejovice, Czech Republic</LI>
 <LI>Budapest, Hungary</LI>
 <LI>Split, Croatia</LI></UL>
 <P>Seems like we did more than that, but I suppose we did visit Prague 3 times&nbsp;(don't ask!). Also got to go to Hungary, which wasn't planned, but our bus fromCesk&#253; Krumlov to Praha broke down, which meant we missed our flight to Croatia... We ended up at the main train station in Prague at 7pm, and went &#8220;which night train looks like fun?&#8221;. Was a good way of doing it, but I think we would've all preferred to go to Croatia instead. Also meant that I only got two days in Split, rather than 5 or 6 days... I could've visited the islands and Dubrovnik, which is apparently amazing. Oh well...</P>
 <P>Was very interesting to go to Berlin&nbsp;- got to hear a lot about the cold war, and communism and the like. We even went on a <A href="http://www.insiderberlintours.com/insidertour.php/cat/14/title/Iron_Curtain_Tour">walking tour</A> done by an ex-army major, <A href="http://www.insiderberlintours.com/insidertour.php/cat/4/title/The_Guides">Nigel</A>, who lived and breathed the cold war - was amazing. Also learnt a lot just travelling through former communist countries - really opened my eyes up about it all.</P>
 <P>A lot of the cities were amazing - so old, and beautiful. Granted, Budapest wasn't so crash hot - it was a little grotty, but it was in the process of getting cleaned up.</P>
 <P>Split, even though it was completely bagged by the <A href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/europe/croatia">Lonely Planet</A>, was quite nice. Not a lot there, but by that point, we didn't care. A nice city to kick back and relax in. Had&nbsp;a very Venetian feel to it, combined with a bit of Greece. Nice place. Apparently Dubrovnik is much nicer, so I would've loved to have gone there.</P>
 <P>Kutn&#225; Hora was a bit freaky - there's an ossuary there, which has the bones of 40,000 people arranged as a chandelier, a huge coat of arms, and various other ornaments - very freaky.</P>
 <P>All in all, planning on going back to Prague - didn't get a chance to do any cultural type things there, and also Cesk&#253; Krumlov - extremely beautiful town. Both a bit touristy, but you can overlook that. Also want to go back to Croatia - a week or so sailing round the islands off Croatia, sounds good to me <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
