<P>Right. Time for another long winded blog entry. I think there's been a lot happening that I haven't had a chance to write about, so here's a bit of a bash at it.</P>
 <P>I'm currently sitting, well, actually, standing on a tube train, on my way into work. Terribly exciting - a distinct lack of free seats, so I get to stand again - just like every morning and evening. A bit annoying, really. Oh well, its only about half an hour on the train. Gets lots more annoying closer to work, as every man and his dog want to get on the train, so it gets kinda packed - an image of sardines comes to mind for some reason...</P>
 <P>I think I've mentioned in passing that I managed to get myself a new place to live, but I haven't actually written about it properly. I now live in a suburb called Tooting Bec (which is such a cool name <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>), which is about 25 minutes from the centre of London. Its a 3 year old, 3 story townhouse, with 4 bedrooms, large kitchen and lounge. Its pretty nice actually. I've got the only room on the ground floor (there's also the kitchen). I'm living with Cath, a girl from Liverpool, and Ryan, a guy from somewhere I can&#8217;t remember at the moment. There's also Debbie, a New Zealander, but she's ducked back home for a 3 month holiday, so in the meantime, we're trying to find someone to move in for a few months.</P>
 <P>I've now been working for <A href="http://www.mergermarket.com/">mergermarket</A> for over two weeks now, and its not too bad. Of course, there's the whole "I'd rather not be working at all", but I think that&#8217;s standard for everyone. I've started getting involved in some slightly bigger stuff now, rather than just bug fixing, but you pretty much have to do the bug fixing to get the knowledge of how it all fits together. Painful, but you cant do much about it. Still haven't entirely got the paperwork sorted out yet, but its getting there. Note to self - must get timesheets sorted, so I can get paid...</P>
 <P>Anyway, this weekend just past, Holly came down to visit from up north, to catch up with people before heading to Ireland, which was good. We got a group of us together (Fish and Lyds, Andrew, Cath, Holly and me), and went and saw <A href="http://www.reducedshakespeare.co.uk/">The Reduced Shakespeare Company</A> with <A href="http://www.reducedshakespeare.co.uk/shakes.htm">The Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged)</A>. All 37 plays in 97 minutes. Not too bad all up - could've been better, but was very funny nonetheless. Also went and saw the <A href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/wpy/">Wildlife Photographer of the Year</A> exhibition, which was pretty good. Still have to get around to organising to do a digital photography course at some point.&nbsp; All up, was a good weekend - too many late nights, and possibly a tad too much alcohol, but it was fun.</P>
 <P>Only issue with the late nights was the fact that I'm now sick again. Last night, was pretty sure I'd be taking the day off, but I felt remarkably good this morning, so its off to work today... Yay. At least I don&#8217;t have to lose out on pay.</P>
 <P><EM><PLEASE work to goes matt while intermission, short a for comfortable yourself make></EM></P>
 <P>Okay, back again. This time, I'm on the train home from work, which is suprisingly not a sardine tin. But, no, wait, here's a whole bunch of people getting on. Oh well, so much for the concept of personal space...</P>
 <P>Feeling much better now than I was yesterday, which is a good thing.</P>
 <P>Hmmm... Cant remember what else I was going to say. Maybe I'll just ramble on for a while anyway...</P>
 <P>Had a meeting today where we ran over the vague plans for what the team is going to be doing over the next while. Damn, there's some exciting stuff going to be happening. Makes me think seriously about hanging around for a while longer than I'd originally planned. Quite a few of the things they're getting into sound really enjoyable, and are things that I know a bit about, and want to learn more. So, we'll see how it goes.</P>
 <P>I think I'm finally getting the hang of things as well. I spent a bit of time investigating some bugs late today, and I tracked them down quite quickly, and figured out how to fix them pretty quickly too. (Only thing was that I couldn't actually fix them, cos they're planned for the next release, but...)</P>
 <P>Nearly forgot that I was supposed to be home by 7.30 tonight, cos we've got someone coming to check out the house. I think I might be late. Oops...</P>
 <P>Went over to <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/">Biscuits</A> place last night, where he cooked up some mexican, and Birte and Celine dropped round. (Birte and Celine are some friends we met via Eva, who we met via Margo, in Scotland. Confused yet?) A few hours of talking bollocks - was fun. Cath also dropped around a bit later on. Was a merry little party.</P>
 <P>This weekend coming, Cath has invited me and biscuit to a complete strangers 40th birthday. Apparently, she's as mad as a hatter, so we should get along fine <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>. Cath says that she's 40, going on 12 or so. Hmmm... Could be scary.</P>
 <P>Anyway, I think that's enough rambling for now. I don't think I've got anything else exciting to share. I should have internet at home soon, so I'll be able to try and get around to replying to some of the emails I've got in my inbox - there's only 57 or so flagged for follow up...</P>
