 <P>A while back, Hugh Macleod, of <A href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/">gapingvoid.com</A> fame, started <A href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001646.html">offering</A> free bottles of <A href="http://www.stormhoek.com/">Stormhoek</A> wine to bloggers&#8230; There was no catch to write about it or anything &#8211; he just wanted to get the name out there. And, I think, amongst bloggers at least, its worked&#8230; Not sure how well its worked outside of that, but it means that when I open it tomorrow night (we&#8217;ve got guests round for dinner), we&#8217;ll talk about it for a while, and maybe they&#8217;ll think of it next time they&#8217;re buying</P>
