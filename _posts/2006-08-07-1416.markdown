<P>Hannah's made me try and grow the tree seedlings that were handed out at the <A href="http://www.benjerry.co.uk/sundae">Ben &amp; Jerry's Sundae in the park</A> concert, as part of their <A href="http://www.benjerry.co.uk/seedtheworld/?mtklink=seedtheworld">seed the world</A> program.</P>

<P>Well, I promise I'll try and look after it - no guarantees they'll survive though. After all, I have managed to kill quite a few cactii in the past...</P>
<P>PS: Kudos to Ben &amp; Jerry's for doing something like this. Granted, a big chunk of it is marketing, but its still really good...</P>
<P>PPS: What should I call it? I'm going for Hubert at the moment... (then again, there was about a dozen seeds... Hubert I through Hubert XII?)</P>
