<P><BR>Currently sitting here in good ol' Edinburgh, relaxing in the castle rock hostel, whiling away the day, revelling in the joy of not having to do anything. It is a very nice feeling. Much better than having to work on your birthday...</P>
 <P>But, I've been thinking lately, trying to sort out what I'm gonna be doing. London is starting to get to me, starting to annoy. I've got some great friends there, but the little things are getting to me. Its not so good.</P>
 <P>I'm definitely heading back to Melbourne for Christmas - I think I'd be hung, drawn, quartered, and then yelled at if I didn't come home (and yes, the yelling would be the worst bit). I'm also getting a bit home sick too - really want to see the family. But after that, well, who knows what I'll do.</P>
 <P>Work is okay - nothing super exciting (then again the last project was a study in how not to create a new product), and the promised exciting new project doesn't seem to be materialising at all. Its been just around the corner for about 6 months...</P>
 <P>But, heading to Edinburgh, its been really good. I s'pose that whenever I've been in Scotland, I've had a good time. So it could be that, but its also a case of the food that I've had here is much better than London fare, and little things like that. Its got a defined city centre, and a very picturesque centre too. Also getting back into the backpacker mode again is a good feeling. Always something mad happening - its great.</P>
 <P>I've definitely got to keep working and pay off some credit card debts, but should have those sorted soon. Once that happens, I'll be able to save a bit, so I can do some more travelling.</P>
 <P>Also got a thing or two in the pipeline - things'll be better if they go the way I hope. If they do, I'll let you know what they are; if not, well, we'll just forget I said anything.</P>
 <P>So, I think its almost definite I stick with the current situation for the rest of the year, and see what happens next year. Maybe London, maybe Edinburgh, maybe Paris, maybe New York, maybe I'll just start travelling and see where I end up. If I run out of money, well, I'll get a job somewhere. Who knows. Maybe I just need to do something different.</P>
 <P>Anyway, this was a bit of a ramble. Not even sure if it helped me to get it out, and it probably didn't enlighten you at all, but, hey, who cares? (that's 5 minutes of your life that you're not getting back <IMG alt=:P class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif" border=0>)</P>
 <P>Time for a show now, so au revoir.<BR></P>
