<P>Oooh.... Not long now...</P>
 <P>Its getting much closer to the time&nbsp;I wing my way away from this bleak dark winter, and into the land of sun and fun (go see <A href="/blog/1168">this post</A> if you don't know what I'm talking about). </P>
 <P>I've sorted out most of the things i need to do (like doing my scuba review, organising flights, insurance&nbsp;etc, buying a new pack etc, etc), but I've still got lots to do before i go in 2 days time...</P>
 <P>Still have to pack up all my stuff, and move out, pack to go, suspend my gym membership, get my bond back, and a few other things... Should be able to get them done before&nbsp;I leave. Hope I can at least.</P>
 <P>But, damn, its a good feeling to be starting to hit the road again. Makes me wonder why&nbsp;I got stuck in a full time job (it was only supposed to be a 3 month contract!!!). But, that said, I've got a bit of $$$ in the bank now, so it makes the travel concept a lot easier.</P>
 <P>So, as long as the immigration guys let me in, I'll be back in Melbourne Saturday morning. Then, <A href="http://www.squiresloft.com.au/">Squires Loft</A>&nbsp;a few days later for one of their amazing steaks! <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0></P>
