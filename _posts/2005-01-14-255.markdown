<P>When I was rather sick, and coughing up lots of horrible stuff, I was drinking hot water with lemon and honey - to sooth the throat and all that.</P>
 <P>The other day Paul tried to pour some lemon juice out of the bottle, and it wouldn't come out. He opened it, and there was lots and lots of grey mouldy stuff in it - generally gross.</P>
 <P>So, I'd been drinking mouldy lemon juice. In hot water, so that may have killed off some of it, but still... No wonder it took me so long to get well(ish).</P>
