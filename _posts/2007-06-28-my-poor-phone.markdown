<p>Seems that my <a href="http://www.t-mobile.co.uk/shop/mobile-phones/phones/pay-monthly/t-mobile/mda-vario/overview/">My MDA Vario</a> was a bit of a casualty of <a href="/blog/back-from-glastonbury">Glastonbury</a>... The touch screen no longer works, and seeing it relies on the touch screen for a lot of things, its not as useful as it could be. It works most of the time, but a few things you cant do with the keyboard - makes it a tad annoying.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I'm still in a contract (until August),so I cant get a new one, and the new phone I want (the <a href="http://www.pdadb.net/index.php?m=specs&amp;id=733">HTC Kaiser</a> - way cool!) isn't out just yet, it seems I'm in a bit of a pickle. Though, luckily, it turns out my phone is still under warranty, so all I have to do is take it back to the shop, and they'll fix it for me. Just have to live without it for a&nbsp;week or so&nbsp;- hope I don't get the shakes again being out of email contact! (Yes... I'm serious.)</p>
