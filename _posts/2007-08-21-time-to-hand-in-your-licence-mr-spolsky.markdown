<p>Just read about <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com">Joel Spolsky's</a> trouble opening a DVD case. Now, I've got a lot of respect for about 3/4 of what he writes, and complete contempt for the rest...</p> <p>Today he rants about the trouble he had <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/08/18.html">opening the Office 2007 DVD case</a>. Apparently its the same as the Vista box, which&nbsp;I opened without even thinking about it.</p> <p>If he's having that much trouble, maybe its time he gave up and went and sat in the corner...</p> <p>And while I'm ranting, maybe I should suggest that he listens to a bit of his own advice?</p>
