<P>Well, Amsterdam is a bit of an odd one, cos this time round, it was just a day trip. We headed in to meet up with Margo (who I met in Scotland), and Andrew. We met up, and wandered around for a while, checked out the place, and had a few beers. All up, didn't see that much of Amsterdam that timeround, but it was good with the five of us just kicking back for a while, and relaxing.</P>
 <P>Then Andrew and I headed down to Rotterdam (Margo's home town), leaving Matt behind (he couldn't be bothered seeing Rotterdam -&nbsp;I think he went back to Utrecht). We ended up sitting around at Margo's place till all hours of the morning, just yarning about all sorts of things. Was good.</P>
 <P>The following day we wandered around Rotterdam, seeing the sights, and getting a bit of a feel for the city. Margo and Andrew had managed to get an opportunity to abseil of a stupidly high tower (unfortunately, only 2 spots - doh!), so I got to take photos for them. Looks like it would have been fun, but crazy.</P>

 <P align=left>After that, we wandered around a bit more, saw some crazy cube houses, i got carried away trying to take arty photos of Margo, saw some pigeons kissing and saw my first real life dutch windmill. Also managed to find an &#8220;Australian Ice Cream&#8221; shop - i could've sworn they were supposed to be &#8220;New Zealand Ice Cream&#8221; shops... (side note - New Zealand was named after a province in The Netherlands - Zeeland.).</P>

 <P align=left>That night, ended up going out partying with Margo, and one of her&nbsp;friends Mara. Was lots of fun, especially with the&nbsp;really bad 80's music <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif">. Left the place at 5am - only reason being that we didn't want to miss the last bus. The party seen in The Netherlands is pretty crazy - it doesn't really kick off till about 1am. But, it was a good night - a lot of fun - just letting go, and who cares what people think about my dancing <IMG alt=:P class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif">.</P>
