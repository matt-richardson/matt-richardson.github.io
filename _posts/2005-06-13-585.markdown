<P>Just thought that its about time I wrote about some of the recent travels I've done.</P>
 <P>Back at the start of may, I headed up to Leeds to visit Amy - a South African girl we met up in Inverness last September or so. It was her birthday (21 again <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>), and I'd been promising to to go visit her for months.</P>
 <P>Quite an interesting weekend - ended up at the pub on the Friday night, and at the table next to us was a small group of guys and girls, all about 18, 19 or so, and a older woman, about 40 or so. They were all drinking and smoking and just talking randomly . Eventually found out that they were a family - and one of the girls was the older woman's daughter;&nbsp;she&nbsp;turned out to be 15! I'm not sure how old her son was. This girl was drinking, smoking, and had quite a few tattoos. It was quite disturbing that this girls mum saw nothing wrong with spending Friday night at the pub with her daughter, and was allowing her to smoke and get drunk. Very scary.</P>
 <P>On the Saturday night, we went out to dinner for her birthday celebration, so I got to meet all her friends there. All the people she's friends with are all married couples; all either pregnant or with young kids. So, it made the conversation at the table quite interesting... Waaay too much talk of pregnancy that night. Quite scary.</P>
 <P>We also did a bit of random wandering around Leeds - it was annoying: we'd go outside to wander around, and it'd start raining; we'd go inside, and it'd stop. Funny though <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>. It was a good weekend though - nice and relaxing. Was also good to see Amy again - she's a good pal. The good thing is that she's moving down to London soon too - yay <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>. </P>
 <P>And other than the 4 hour bus trip up and back, there's not else to tell, really. From what I saw of Leeds, its not that exciting - its just another place. Nice and relaxing though - good place to go occasionally and recharge the batteries :)</P>
 <P>Hopefully soon I'll get organised and write about my other weekend away, last bank holiday weekend (read: long weekend), down to Brighton.</P>
