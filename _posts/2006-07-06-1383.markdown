<P>Finally, instead of purely Microsoft bashing, law-makers have finally realised that the iPod is anti-competitive.</P>
 <P><A href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_hi_te/france_itunes_law">French law-makers have approved a law</A> forcing Apple to make its music format available to other manufacturers, rather than only allowing iTunes music to be played on iPods...</P>
