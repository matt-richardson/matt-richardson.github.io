<P>Now, this one is going to be a bit harder - I have to write it all here and now, rather than just&nbsp;dishing up a pre-prepared one...</P>
 <P>So, its probably a good idea to head back to the start, and tell you about it proper like... So:</P>
 <P>I headed off to travel <A href="http://trekamerica.com/tours/slw.html">from Los Angeles, through to New York</A>, over a sum total of 19 days... It might be easier with a bit of a picture:</P>

 <P>Unfortunately, New Orleans (pronounced &#8220;norlans&#8221; apparently) had that bugger of a hurricane a while back, so its a little &#8220;disorganised&#8221; at the moment (feel free to let your mind ponder on what kind of disorganisation a hurricane can do to a city...). But, its a complete mess, and they were still finding bodies, so we ended up going to Memphis instead. General itinerary looked something like this:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Los Angeles</LI>
 <LI>Death Valley</LI>
 <LI>Las Vegas</LI>
 <LI>Grand Canyon</LI>
 <LI>Monument Valley (aka Navajo Nation)</LI>
 <LI>Texas (El Paso, Big Bend National park)</LI>
 <LI>San Antonio</LI>
 <LI>Dallas</LI>
 <LI>Memphis</LI>
 <LI>Atlanta</LI>
 <LI>Washington DC</LI>
 <LI>New York</LI></UL>
 <P>I do believe there were a few more places we stopped, and a few that we stayed a few nights at, but that was the general gist of it all. I just posted about the first 6 days of the tour, which covered up to Monument Valley or so. There's probably more detail that i can add about that, but&nbsp;I might stop this one about now, and continue in another post...</P>
