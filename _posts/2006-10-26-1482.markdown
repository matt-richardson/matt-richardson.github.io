<P>Disgusted in <A href="http://www.natwest.com">NatWest</A> right now...</P>
 <P>1. They advertise 'Phones answered 24/7'. Until you ring up and get told 'Our business hours are 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday'. Make up your mind.</P>
 <P>2. Rang up the number on the back of the card, which said 'Press1 for the cheque referral service, press 2 for other enquires'. Pressed 2, got a message that told me to ring customer services, and hung up, without even telling me the number. Could it not have transferred me?</P>
 <P>3. Eventually found a number that worked,&nbsp;and rang up to enquire about something, and as soon as I started questioning why he was unable to do anything useful, he hung up on me.</P>
 <P>Hmmm... Anyone know a decent UK bank?</P>
