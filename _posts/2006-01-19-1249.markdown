<P>In one way, its gratifying when someone tells you a secret - it means that they trust you. However, it adds a burden to you in your life - you've now got to walk around knowing this secret for the rest of your life. Sometimes, it seems that it'd be easier if they didn't tell you.</P>
 <P>Now, if its a secret about someone else, or something that&#8217;s been told to the person in confidence - well, I'd rather not know at all, actually. That makes life way too hard to figure out if you don&#8217;t know how much you're supposed to know... </P>
 <P>Anyway, no real purpose to this, just something that I was thinking about... </P>
