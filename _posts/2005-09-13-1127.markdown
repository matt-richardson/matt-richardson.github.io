<P>Got a little carried away the other day, and went and bought myself some new toys...</P>
 <P>Got myself one of <A href="http://www.jessops.com/search/viewproduct.cfm?PRODUCT=CANEOS350DB1855&amp;BRAND=&amp;CONTINUE=false&amp;FEATS=&amp;FIRSTPRICE=&amp;KEYWORD=&amp;LEVEL=&amp;MODELNUMBER=&amp;NEWQUERY=True&amp;NODE=0&amp;NODE_PATH=0&amp;ORD=ASC&amp;ORDERBY=&amp;QUANTITY=10&amp;RECENT=0&amp;REFINE=&amp;SEARCH_FOR=eos%20350d&amp;SEARCHNODE=0&amp;SEARCHURL=dointellisearch.cfm&amp;SECONDPRICE=&amp;SHOWCASEID=&amp;STARTROW=1&amp;SUBS=&amp;WORD_SEARCH=Y&amp;">these little babies</A>, and also one of <A href="http://www.jessops.com/search/viewproduct.cfm?Product=CANIXUSD50&amp;CFID=8780719&amp;CFTOKEN=1266686-77f27c52-af27-41f3-af9a-e0e59496e9c9">these little babies</A>.</P>
 <P>For those that couldn't be bothered following the links, the first one is a digital SLR camera, the Canon EOS 350D - 8 mega pixels. Its pretty much the entry level model, but seeing I don't know that much about SLR cameras, its probably better to not spend an absolute fortune on my first camera. I've had a bit of a play with it already, and it seems to come out with some pretty nice shots... Just got to learn more about the funky effects that you can do with them.</P>
 <P>The second is a pocket point-and-click model, the Canon Ixus 50, a 5 mega pixel jobby. Got this one cos its a perfect size to just stick in your pocket - much easier to fit in your pocket than a SLR camera. Looks like its a decent camera, but the screen seems to be a bit grainy.&nbsp;You can do some cool things with it, like pick a certain colour, and the rest of the photo will be black and white, except for anything that color. Pretty cool, really. </P>
 <P>So, all in all, a pretty easy way to spend &#163;1000...</P>
 <P>Managed to take about 250 photos for Andrea &amp; Marks wedding the other day, and managed to get some decent shots out of it. As&nbsp;I learn more about the camera, hopefully they'll get even better... Have to do a course at some point soon to learn some more about it...</P>
 <P>Hopefully should upload some photos within the week for your enjoyment <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
