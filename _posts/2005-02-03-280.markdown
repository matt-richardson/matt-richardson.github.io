<P>For some odd reason, I was just talking to <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/">Biscuit </A>on <A href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</A> about the man from St Ives, you know, the one from the riddle: </P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>As I was going to St. Ives, <BR>I met a man with seven wives. <BR>The seven wives had seven sacks, <BR>The seven sacks had seven cats, <BR>The seven cats had seven kits. <BR>Kits, cats, sacks, wives - <BR>How many were going to St. Ives?</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>And I couldn't remember the riddle, so I looked it up. And, I found that there's a pub, in St Ives, called <A href="http://www.st-ives.info/pubs/SevenWives.html">Seven Wives</A>. </P>
 <P>I dont know about you, but I think that's kinda cool. Maybe its just me... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
