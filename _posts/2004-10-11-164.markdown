<P><STRONG>(written about the 5th of October)</STRONG></P>
 <P>Back to the grindstone again, time to write some more... i'm currently sitting on a train in the Netherlands, going from Maastricht to Utrecht, and not understanding a single word of Dutch... Makes it fun <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif"></P>
 <P>Anyway, I think I finished off the last entry in Roma, so, now its onto Florence, also known as Firenze. I must admit that I liked Florence much more than Roma - a combination of a much smaller city, cleaner and less hectic, and a lessening of the 'new country scariness'. Its also a much more pedestrian city - as in lots of pedestrians wandering around, and the streets are pretty pedestrian-friendly. So, much more enjoyable.</P>
 <P>Ended up staying in a place called 'Firenze Inn' - a cool place that was pretty much a big old Italian house, with 9 beds in it. The hostel had just been taken over by a new company, and they only had a licence for 9 beds, in a place that could have held 40 (the previous company had lots of beds, ignoring the licence limitations). So, Matt and I had a huge room (one that could've fitted at least 12 people) to ourselves. Pretty cool.</P>
 <P>Made the effort to go the the Galleria D'Accademia (which held Michaelangelo's famous statue of David - pretty cool, but kind of a let down), and the Galleria D'Uffizi (which had lots of famous paintings by lots of famous people (can you tell that I wasn't that excited? (there was 2 paintings in the entire place that I liked (as opposed to admiring the skill required), but downstairs, there was a exhibition of modern art, where I liked quite a few of the pieces... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif"> Always knew I was a Philistine <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif">))). Thing was, seeing Florence is such a tourist destination, the lines to get in were absolutely painful. Took about an hour and a half to get into one, and about two hours for the other. didn't matter - I got a fair way through my book while waiting. (Side note - Stephen King has serious issues. I was reading 'The Tommyknockers', and its seriously twisted.)</P>
 <P>Headed back to the hostel one afternoon (we stayed there about 4 days), and we were both ready to get an early night. Walked into the kitchen, and there was 5 of the people we met in Roma. So much for the early night... Was lots of fun though - especially when the waitress brought out the 3.5 litre 'rocket ships' filled with Heinekin...&nbsp;<IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif"> One of the scary things was that the place was filled with Aussies on a Contiki tour, so it was pretty scarring.</P>
 <P>Other than that, found the Ponte Vechio (a cool bridge covered with jewellers shops), and Piazza Michaelangelo (a cool lookout where you can see a panaromic view of the whole city). I wandered up to see a fortress in the north of the city, which was definitely not worth it. Though, I did find a park (which had no tourists in it! Only locals!), and sat and read for a while. Very relaxing - just what I needed.</P>
 <P>And I think i'll leave it there, and save Pisa and Cinque Terre for the next time.</P>
