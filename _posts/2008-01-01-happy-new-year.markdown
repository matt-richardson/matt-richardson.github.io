<p>Happy new year, boys and girls! <br></p><p>Hope you had a great 2007, and an even better 2008!</p><p>(oh, and hope your head isn't too bad after the new years celebrations!)&nbsp;</p><p>Will try and post a bit more on the blog next year - now that i'm officially unemployed, have a few plans on what I want to do with the site and a few things to post. Still got the trips to Egypt and Africa left to post about, and a gazillion and one pics to share...<br></p><p>Anyway, if i haven't spoken to you in a while, hopefully catch up (or at least speak!) soon.<br></p>
