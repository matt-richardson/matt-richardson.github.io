<P>Hmmm&#8230; Seems I&#8217;m on a roll here with the posts&#8230; Just trying to catch up with all the things I&#8217;ve been meaning to post about for a long time&#8230;</P>
 <P>As of a couple of weeks ago, I&#8217;m now a lot poorer, but also a lot more planned up&#8230; I booked my Christmas holidays&#8230;</P>
 <P>Here&#8217;s the plan</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Fly London to Melbourne (via Sydney <IMG alt=:( class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border=0>), leaving December 8th, arriving December 10th</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI>(lots of time with family and friends in melbourne, enjoying the beautiful Australian summer <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>)</LI>
 <LI>(some kind of trip up to Queensland to go diving, as soon as Allison and Jeremy&nbsp;sort something out)</LI></UL>
 <LI>Fly Melbourne to Christchurch (NZ), leaving January 8th</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI>(a week or so with Eva, bumming around and checking out a tiny bit of NZ)</LI></UL>
 <LI>Fly Christchurch to Los Angeles, leaving January 15th&nbsp; (arriving 7 hours before I leave&#8230;)</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI>(Tour with <A href="http://www.trekamerica.com/tours/slw.html">Trek America</A> across the southern US to New York, leaving January 18th, arriving February 5th)</LI></UL>
 <LI>Fly New York to London, leaving February 8th, arriving February 9th</LI></UL>
 <P>So&#8230; roughly Â£2000 later, I&#8217;m sorted. It&#8217;s gonna be great fun.</P>
 <P>If you&#8217;re in any of those places (and most of you will be (that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going there)), holler out, and we&#8217;ll do something.</P>
