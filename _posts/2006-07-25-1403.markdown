<P>Was 32&#176; C at my desk today, and 33&#176; C or so on the train home. Heard on the radio that the average temp for this time of year is 22&#176; C. Its been toasty for a couple of weeks now, and its not a nice heat, its a really humid erky heat...</P>
<P>Oh well, cant be that bad. At least its not freezing like it is in Melbourne
