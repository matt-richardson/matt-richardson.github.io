<p>Just on the off chance that I still have people that read my blog (not entirely convinced i do <IMG alt=":S" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-7.gif">), I want to do a quick straw poll. Check out the following comic from <a href="http://www.xkcd.com" mce_href="http://www.xkcd.com">www.xkcd.com:</a></p><p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/commitment.png" title="xkcd - commitment" alt="xkcd - commitment" mce_src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/commitment.png" border="0" height="194" hspace="20" width="740"></p><p>Now... Do which of the following categories do you fit in:</p><p>a) the guy in the first panel? or<br></p><p>b) the choir of angels?<br></p><p>Granted, this will probably really only apply to married folk, but, hey even so, tell me what you think....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
