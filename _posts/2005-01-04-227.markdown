 <P>It seems that the curse &#8220;may you live in interesting times&#8221; might have been inflicted on me again... (Not to self - stop calling Confucius funny names...)</P>
 <P>Momentus times, it seems, momentus times...</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>some friends of mine <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/2005/01/congrats-to-andrea-and-mark.html">just got engaged</A>... 
 <LI>some friends of mine just split up (after&nbsp;4 years or so) 
 <LI>a&nbsp;friend of mine split up with his girlfriend (but this was last year though) 
 <LI>a&nbsp;friend of mine finally found himself a woman (once again, last year) 
 <LI>a friend of mine got himself an evening in jail for &#8220;drunk in a public place&#8221;. On Christmas eve, even.</LI></UL>
 <P>Scary stuff. And I'm sure its only going to get worse... <IMG alt==:0 class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-3.gif" border=0></P>
