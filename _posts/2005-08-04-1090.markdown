<P>Okay, now that I'm in the mood to write some stuff on this blog-thang, I might as well keep writing for a bit...</P>
 <P>Vague travel plans coming up...</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>August 6th - 8th - Rotterdam for the weekend to visit Margo and Mara</LI>
 <LI>August 21st - 27th - Edinburgh for the <A href="http://www.edfringe.com/">fringe festival</A> and <A href="http://www.edintattoo.co.uk/">military tattoo</A></LI>
 <LI>September 3rd &amp; 4th - Nottingham to visit Wendy for her birthday</LI>
 <LI>September 10th - Mark and Andreas wedding&nbsp;(well, if she gives up her smoking, at least)</LI>
 <LI>September 11th - 14th - Barcelona with Rob and Matt - <EM>maybe</EM></LI>
 <LI>September 15th - 20th - <A href="http://www.backpackertours.co.uk/britain_uk_england_tours/oktoberfest_opening_tour.htm">Munich for Oktoberfest</A><SUP>1</SUP></LI>
 <LI>October sometime - going to Morocco - <EM>maybe</EM></LI>
 <LI>November sometime - going diving in Egypt - <EM>maybe</EM></LI></UL>
 <P>And then we kick into the big travel plans... December 15th or so - I'm planning on flying to Melbourne, possibly stopping in&nbsp;Singapore for a few days (if Jo ends up moving there), then 2 weeks over Christmas, up to Queensland with Jeremy (plus one?<SUP>2</SUP>) and Leigh and Allison for a weeks diving just after new years. After that, a few final days with the family, then over to New Zealand to visit a few random strangers that I've met (in a random countries, of course)&nbsp;for a few days. Then, over to Los Angeles to jump on a <A href="http://www.trekamerica.com/tours/slw.html">3 week backpacker bus trek thing</A> across the southern part of the US, ending up in New York. As far as i can tell, that will take me till about the 8th of Feb, then it will be back to London to pay off the credit card debt for a few months... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>Anyway, this big travel plan is kinda reliant on there being some reasonable priced flights available - Was looking to pick up a round-the-world ticket for about &#163;1100 or so. But, putting that itinerary into a few websites (like <A href="http://www.opodo.co.uk/">opodo</A> or <A href="http://www.expedia.co.uk/">expedia</A>) gave me a price of around &#163;3500, which is a little more than&nbsp;I was planning on spending... Will have to drop into <A href="http://www.flightcentre.co.uk/">Flight Centre</A> or something to find out if its feasible...</P>
 <P>So, thats the plan. If you're going to be anywhere near where I'm gonna be, holler out, and we'll raise a glass to, well, something.</P>

 <P><SUP>1</SUP> Yes, i do know that its odd that they have Oktoberfest in September<BR><SUP>2</SUP> Yes, i know that its unlikely that Jeremy will manage to get himself a girl by then, but, hey, <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/2005/07/news.html">stranger things have happened</A>...</P>
