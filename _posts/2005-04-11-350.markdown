<P>(This is a geek post - if you're not a geek [ie, most of you], skip it)</P>
<P>For the maybe 3 or 4 people who read this that&nbsp;are developers, they most likely use Visual Studio.NET.</P>
<P>In VB6, you used to be able to go Ctrl+R to show the project explorer. Now, even with the VB6 keyboard layout in VS.NET, you cant use Ctrl+R to show the solution explorer. It just sits there and helpfully says &#8220;(Ctrl+R) was pressed. Waiting for second key of chord.", and then doesn't do anything.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>
    Go to Tools/Options/<BR>
    Select Environment folder and then Keyboard
  </P>
  <P>
    Remove or change the commands for the following shortcuts:<BR>
    * Edit.SwapAnchor<BR>
    * Edit.ToggleWordWrap<BR>
    * Edit.ViewWhiteSpace
  </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>And it all magically works again! Yay <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>
