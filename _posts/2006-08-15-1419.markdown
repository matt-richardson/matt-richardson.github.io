<P>In&nbsp;four days, I hit the 2 years of being in the UK. Damn, that time's gone fast.</P>
 <P>But, the thing that's gonna make it interesting is that <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/">Andrew</A> is buggering off. He's getting married (to the loverly (cough) <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/2005/07/news.html">Cath</A>) on the 1st of Sept, and then heading to South America (for three months) and Australia (for a minimum of&nbsp;six months).</P>
 <P>So, that leaves me pretty much on my own here. There's still Andrea, but pretty much everyone else is friends that I've made here. Was easy when I came over, as I had two really good mates here, but&nbsp;<A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/paulsblog/">Paul</A> left a while back, and now Andrew's out of here.</P>
 <P>Add to the fact that I just found out that <A href="/blog/379">Shawn</A> is leaving too - damn. <IMG alt=:( class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>So, from here on in, its really down to seeing if I can survive without those anchors. Yep, the next 6 months is going to be interesting.</P>
