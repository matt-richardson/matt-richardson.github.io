<P>Felt that I should get involved in this political thing for a bit:</P>
 <P>The <A href="http://committeetoprotectbloggers.blogspot.com/">Committee to Protect Bloggers</A> has announced today (Feb 22nd)&nbsp; as <A href="http://committeetoprotectbloggers.blogspot.com/2005/01/committee-to-protect-bloggers_20.html">Free Arash and Mojtaba Day</A>. </P>
 <P align=center><IMG alt="Free Mojtaba and Arash Banner" src="/images/free_mojtaba_and_arash.gif"></P>
 <P>These guys have been imprisioned by the Iranian Authorities for speaking out against a crackdown on the free press.</P>
 <P>I just sent off a letter to the <A href="http://www.iranembassy.org.au/webpages/5.html">Iranian Ambassador</A> to Australia, adding my voice&nbsp;- if you feel strongly enough about this, feel free to do the same. The <A href="http://committeetoprotectbloggers.blogspot.com/2005/01/committee-to-protect-bloggers_20.html">Free Arash and Mojtaba Day</A> page has suggestions on how to do something.</P>
