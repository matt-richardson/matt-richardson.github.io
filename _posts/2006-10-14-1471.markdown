<P>Well, its official, its final, and I'm not worried about it at all.</P>
 <P>I resigned&nbsp;on Wednesday&nbsp;from company I was contracting at<SUP>[1]</SUP>. Finally.</P>
 <P>I've got no new job, but judging by the fact that I uploaded my CV to a few job sites last night, and got 8 phone calls today, it doesn't seem like it'll be a problem.</P>
 <P>If all else fails, well, I can survive till around mid December anyway. But, I'm positive I'll have something sorted, maybe with a week or so off in between.</P>
 <P>Learnt some great stuff, had some great opportunities, but also didn't get the key opportunities I wanted, and well, politics reared its ugly head once too often.</P>
 <P>Its a relief, and very&nbsp;freeing. Who knows what the next door will bring <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0>.</P>
