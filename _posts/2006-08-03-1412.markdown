 <P>Funny too. <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>In other news an Australian man was arrested in Italy for an assault on a local man following the football match between Australia and Italy. Witnesses say the Australian man was 20m away when the incident happened. The victim suffered a fractured skull, a cardiac arrest and has developed diabetes as a result of the incident. He is expected to recover in a few minutes.</P>
