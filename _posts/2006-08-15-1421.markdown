<P>This weekend, going to head up for a nice weekend away in the <A href="http://www.golakes.co.uk/">Lakes District </A>(north west corner of England). So, a weekend of relaxing and hikes - should be good.</P>
 <P>Then, the following week, Dan, Rob &amp; Matt arrive, and I'm starting my holidays.</P>
 <P>The vague plan is: start of with a slow drive up to Liverpool, stopping off at a few places on the way (so Dan can get his England fix). Then staying&nbsp;few days around Liverpool for many commiseration drinks before Andrew slips on the ceremonial shackles, and marries Cath... (love ya, Cath<IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>).</P>
 <P>On the 3rd of Sept, going to fly to Berlin with Charlie and <A href="http://thewrathofgrapes.blogspot.com/">Matt</A>, for a few days there, then heading south. Hopefully going to hit Prague, Budapest, Bratislava, Chesky Krumlov, and a few other cool places round there. Hopefully make it as far as Croatia, but not counting on it. Only traveling for 3 weeks, so don't want to rush it too much.</P>
 <P>Should be fun! <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0></P>
