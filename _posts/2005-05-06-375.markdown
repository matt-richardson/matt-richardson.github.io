<P>Just a short note to say that I'm back from Turkey, and back in the old grind again...</P>
 <P>Actually, I've been back for nearly a week now, but I've been too lazy to post anything. I've also been too lazy to reply to any emails, so, if you're waiting for a reply from me, I apologise - I'll get there eventually... Maybe.</P>
 <P>Turkey was great- Istanbul was lot different to what I expected - a lot more modern than I expected. I had a good time down at Gallipoli - got a little knarky at all the yobo Australians there, but it was still good. I'll come back and write a proper post at some point soon. Hopefully.</P>
