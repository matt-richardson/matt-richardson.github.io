 <LI>Needed to sort out a few minor things like money and stuff. </LI>
 <LI>People keep hassling me to upload photos.</LI>
 <LI>Need to update the blog. Still need to write about Austria, Germany and The Netherlands.</LI>
 <LI>Need to email and call lots of people (I'll get there, I promise...).</LI>
