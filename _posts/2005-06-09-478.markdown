<P>Had an interesting Sunday morning last weekend... I'd just had a nice long relaxing shower, dried off, and headed downstairs, back to my room. Now, my room sits directly underneath the shower (perceptive people here are going oh-oh already).</P>
 <P>The "interesting" nee "exciting" part of doing this was the discovering the fact that it was raining. In my room.</P>
 <P>There was this nice little river of water flowing from the roof, right onto my pillow. Surprisingly enough, I wasn't too happy about this state of affairs.</P>
 <P>Got in touch with the landlord, and he had a plumber around within 3 hours to fix it. On a Sunday even. Was fairly impressive. Now, I've just got to find out what he's doing about the hole in my roof (and the mould that's growing in there).</P>
 <P>I s'pose I should be grateful that it didn't happen when I was in my bed. That would not have been a good way to wake up...</P>
