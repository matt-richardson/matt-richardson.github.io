<P>I've known for a long time that Britain has a real pub culture, but until yesterday, I'd never really realised what a bad thing it is.</P>
 <P>I'd seen some bad things, but they were the kind of thing to shake your head at, and then move on. For example, seeing a mother bring 2 kids (one in a stroller) into a pub in the middle of the day, then sit down with her mates and start smoking and drinking.</P>
 <P>But, yesterday, down at the pub here in Leeds, sitting at the table next to us, in the over-eighteen-only section, was a group of people. I vaguely guessed that they were all about 18-20or so, except for one older lady. They were all drinking, and smoking, and talking of random things - as you do at the pub. But, found out that the older lady was the mother of two of them, a girl and a guy. She turned out to be 15, 16 in 2 weeks. Yet, here she was, at the pub, tattoos and all, drinking and smoking. Finding this out, I had a second look around, and realised that quite a few of them were a bit younger than I first thought. And some of those random conversations were not the kind of conversations that a normal person would have around their mother.</P>
 <P>I'm worried.</P>
