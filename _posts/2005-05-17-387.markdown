<P>But i just updated my <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/matt/myblogroll.html">blogroll</A>. For those that dont know what that means, well, go outside and play, and be grateful. Very grateful.</P>
 <P>For those that disregarded the previous advice, and for some odd reason are still reading,well, its a list of all the blogs I read (well, try to, that is). Seeing its auto-generated,&nbsp;I couldn't get it to list the ones that&nbsp;I read all the time, and the ones&nbsp;I read when i'm bored out of my brain, but, well, <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/matt/myblogroll.html">check it out</A>. There's definitely some gems in there...</P>
