 <P>A few funny things I just remembered from London:</P>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI>Air Sahara - one of the airlines that I flew on whilst in India - one of the budget airlines (kinda like easyjet, or virgin blue in Aus) - apparently has the worst safety record in the world... Glad that I heard that after I got off the plane. Only heard this as second hand info, so don&#8217;t quote me on that...</LI>
 <LI>While staying at Paul's place, we went and saw the latest Bourne movie, which had a bit of the movie set in Goa, in India. Was quite interesting seeing it, and going "been there" a few times. Then one of the locations looked really familier, and I think it may have been the movie they were filming when I visited Goa with Paul (from infosys). Freaky. Good chance it wasn't, but if it was, cool. Other than that, don&#8217;t bother seeing the mvoie. Good storyline, ruined by a director who was trying to be arty with the camera, and inflict migraines and/or epilepsy on the audience.</LI></UL>
 <P></P>
 <P>Anyway, that was my exciting bit of stuff that I absolutely had to share... <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif"></P>
