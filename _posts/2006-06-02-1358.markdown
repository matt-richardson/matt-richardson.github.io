<P>Just rang the British Consulate again, and found out that it was processed this morning (over a week after submission), and its gone for final approval, after which, it goes to the visa room (where they stick the visa in the passport), and then to dispatch (which is next day delivery).</P>
 <P>So, looks like I'm not flying on Sunday -&nbsp;the best estimate I could get from the woman was next Wednesday or Thursday, but no guarantees.</P>
 <P>The thing is, there's absolutely no way they can expediate it. </P>
 <P>They go by the theory that there's no problems with making someone fly from the UK to Australia to apply for the visa, and then forcing them to sit and twiddle their thumbs while they process the application in their own sweet time...</P>
 <P>Gah! Damn bureaucracy!</P>
