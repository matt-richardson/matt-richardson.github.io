<P>Okay, time for a quick update on travels...</P>
 <P>Come this Friday morning, I'm heading over to Ireland for the Easter break. I'm heading out to a place called <A href="http://www.inishbofin.com/welcome.htm">Inishbofin</A>, a tiny little island off the west coast - population 200. A friend of mine, Holly, is running a hostel out there, with one of her friends, Tess. And seeing that <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com">Biscuit</A> got <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/2005/03/news-ish.html">a better offer </A>for&nbsp;his easter break, i thought I'd head out there...&nbsp;</P>
 <P>Also, Biscuit and I are heading out to Turkey for <A href="http://istanbullife.org/anzac-2005/anzac_day_tours-a.htm">Anzac Day</A>, along with 10,000 or so other Aussies and NZers... We head over to Istanbul on the 21st of April, and fly back on the 27th. So, we get a bit of a tour of some of Turkey, and the Gallipolli thang, and also a day or so just to wander around Istanbul.&nbsp;<A href="http://oneroundpebble.com/PaulsBlog/archive/2005/03/06/308.aspx">Paul &amp; Lyds</A> are going to be there too (as they start on their travels), and also going to (hopefully) meet up with Bec (a friend&nbsp;I used to work with at Kmart). So, that should be fun.</P>
 <P>I'm slowly sorting out other travel plans for the rest of the year - think I've got it kinda sorted now, but just need to finalise things, so&nbsp;I can let the boss know...</P>
