<P>Bright and early Sunday morning, <A href="http://biscuit-rant.blogspot.com/2005/01/off-to-france.html">Biscuit</A>, <A href="http://oneroundpebble.com/PaulsBlog/archive/2005/01/09/248.aspx">Paul &amp; Lyds</A>, Leigh, Jon and I are off to <A href="http://www.skisolutions.co.uk/chalets/chaletdetail.cfm?id=477&amp;res=All&amp;rat=All&amp;pri=All&amp;searchname=Percee&amp;section=name&amp;row=1">Chalet hotel L&#8217;Aiguille Percee</A> in <A href="http://www.tignes.net/">Tignes</A>, France, for a week of skiing. Yay!</P>
 <P>So, I get to learn to ski, which I'm told is not too hard if you've water-skied before. So, should be fun, but cold.&nbsp;The town is pretty ugly apparently, but the skiing is really good. So, I'll take good skiing over a good-looking town. Its also got a pretty good night-life, I'm told <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Hmm... Note to self: Go hire some ski gear.&nbsp;Wandering around ski fields in a t-shirt is probably not a good idea...</P>
