<P>I've just booked flights back to Aus for next month.</P>
 <P>I'm flying out in the evening of Thursday the 18th of May, arriving in Melbourne on Saturday the 20th, at 7am.</P>
 <P>I'll stick around for&nbsp;9 days, then fly out at midnight on the 29th. </P>
 <P>Not very long, but it'll be long enough to sort out my visa, drop by my cousins wedding, meet my new nephew. I might even get a chance to catch up with a few people while I'm there.</P>
 <P>Yay! <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0></P>
 <P>PS: probably bit a bit out of it when i start work the day after i arrive back in london, but, hey, its all fun <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0><BR>PPS: still no takers on where that title comes from?</P>
