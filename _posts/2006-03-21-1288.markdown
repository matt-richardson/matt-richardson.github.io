<P>About time&nbsp;I thought I'd share the fact that I finally got around to finding a place, and have now moved in. I now live right near <A href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=canning+town+station&amp;ll=51.514399,0.007935&amp;spn=0.016318,0.047293">Canning Town station</A>, in the docklands.</P>
 <P>And now, for your general edification, here's some pics:</P>
