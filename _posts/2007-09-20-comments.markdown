<p>I'd pretty much resigned myself to the fact that no-one actually reads my blog anymore, when I did a quick check and realised that I hadn't actually enabled comments... So, kinda makes it hard to comment.</p><p>So, enabled. Hopefully, it doesn't kick off a deluge of spam...</p><p>Feel free to go back and add your comments now <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif"></p>
