<P>Was quite amused the other day when&nbsp;I sat down to watch <A href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143145/">The World Is Not Enough</A>&nbsp;(you know, the James Bond one), and they have that chase scene with the boats, right near the start:</P>

 <P>The amusing thing is that I can look out my window and see that <STRIKE>monstrosity</STRIKE> dome... <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.&nbsp;Just one of the good things about living in London <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
