<P>Well, its 3am, I should be heading to bed, and so, seeing I've just been asked (again) why its called OneRoundPebble, I thought I might espouse my views on this most pertinent of topics.</P>
 <P>As I'm sure you can see, I'm in full possession of my faculties, and make this deposition of my own free will.</P>
 <P>Or Something Like That<SUP><FONT size=1>TM</FONT></SUP>.</P>
 <P>Anyway, <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/PaulsBlog">Paul</A> and I used to have a website, called <A href="http://www.fishandmatt.com/">fishandmatt.com</A>. This worked for a while, and let us do all sorts of things that non-computer nerds wouldn't even dream of doing. And, before you ask, no, it didn't involve any of <A href="http://fiascofarm.com/goats/index.htm">this</A>, <A href="http://www.flashmob.co.uk/archives/000031.php">this</A>, <A href="http://www.unclemelon.com/olympics.html">that</A>, the <A href="http://www.studenthouse.net/pats20inches/karaoke.html">other thing</A>, nor any hamster rituals.</P>
 <P>Moving right along. Seeing I was going to go overseas, and I wanted somewhere to put my blog (this thing that you're reading now), and my photos, and I wanted to tell everyone where to find it, and also that I'd been thinking for a while that fishandmatt.com just sounded dodgy, I made the earth shattering decision to do something about it. Oh, and there was the vague possibility that Andrew/Biscuit was going to put some stuff up there, so it wouldn't have made much sense.</P>
 <P>So, after many coffees, many sleepless nights, many domain name searches, and the occasional considered thought, I came up with OneRoundPebble. Its got that kind of ring to it that makes it memorable, different, and just the right level of <A href="/images/WhyOneRoundPebbleCoolnessStats.jpg">coolness</A> that I was looking for.</P>
 <P>So that, my friends is why its called OneRoundPebble.com.</P>
 <P><STRONG>PS - </STRONG>anybody who wishes to complain about the content of this post, and the slanderous possibility that it doesn't actually answer the question, should get their lawyer to contact <A href="http://www.mattsreallyexpensivelawyer.com">mine</A>.</P>
