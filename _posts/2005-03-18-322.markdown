<P>And I thought that Melbournes weather was odd.</P>
 <P>Only a few weeks ago, it was snowing - pretty heavily even, and it was bitterly cold. Today, I was walking around in a t-shirt. Its warmed up a <STRONG>*lot*</STRONG>.</P>
 <P>Apparently Fridays going to be 19&#176; or so, and Saturday 21&#176;! <IMG alt==:0 class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-3.gif" border=0>&nbsp;Scary.</P>
 <P>That said, I have been told that getting snow that late was very odd, and its now definitely well into spring.</P>
 <P>Ahh, I can see it now. It hits 21&#176;, and the streets will be filled with pasty skinned English guys, who've decided its a good idea to walk around shirtless... Gah!</P>
