<P>Just because I can, here&#8217;s another one for you:</P>
 <P>Seems that I&#8217;ve been away from good old sunny Melbourne for quite a while now. Pretty sure it was August 17th, 2005 or so when I left Aus, so I think that means I&#8217;ve been gone for just over 14 months&#8230; </P>
 <P>Since then, I&#8217;ve been to quite a few different countries (Scotland, Italy, Austria, Germany (twice), The Netherlands (4? 5? times), Greece, France (twice), Turkey and Belgium) and learnt lots of phrases in lots of languages, some of which&nbsp;I can even remember! <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>. I&#8217;ve been on *lots* of flights, and generally bummed around a lot. </P>
 <P>In the meantime, back home, my dad hit a bit of a rough patch (and things still aren&#8217;t the best &#8211; not good <IMG alt=:( class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border=0>), and my sister is now pregnant (definitely good <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0>). </P>
 <P>Over this side of the world, some friends got married, some friends got engaged, some friends buggered off back home, some friends come over (most of which left again <IMG alt=:~ class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-7.gif" border=0>), and I&#8217;ve made quite a few good friends. Also quite a few acquaintances that I&#8217;ll be able to drop in on at some point in random cities around the world <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>All in all, its been a pretty good time, but I&#8217;m definitely missing family and friends&#8230; Will get my fill this Christmas, and be ready and raring to go again next year. Not ready to head back to Melbourne permanently, but it&#8217;ll be good to get some decent food and coffee and culture in <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0>. <BR></P>
