<P>I've decided one of the bad things about being over here is the lack of females that&nbsp;I can&nbsp;dragoon into&nbsp;helping me shop <IMG alt=:( class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>I had to go buy some stuff today, cos its getting annoying wearing the same&nbsp;things for nearly 5 months. There I was, braving the hoards of bargain shoppers, looking through what passes for fashion here in the UK (I mean, does anyone actually buy that stuff? I mean, really!). I wanted to buy some jeans, as my old ones had a hole in them, and they're torn. Only problem is, the ones in the shops are in the same condition! Gah! How is this fashion? There was a t-shirt that had seams and patches on the outside. Stupid. Why cant I just find normal clothes? And then when I do find some, have to figure out if it actually suits me - as if I know!</P>
 <P>Gah. Over it now though. Managed to get a jumper and a long-sleeve t-shirt though. Think they're alright. If they're not okay, I'll just have to hope that everyone's polite enough not to say anything <IMG alt=":D" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-2.gif" border=0>.</P>
 <P>Note to self: get a girl to go shopping with. <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
