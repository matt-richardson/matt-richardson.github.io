<P>&lt;Rant mode="on"&gt;</P>
 <P>I'd just like to rant about rubbish bins for a few minutes... Or more to the point, I'd like to rant about the *lack* of rubbish bins in London's streets and tube stations...</P>
 <P>There are *no* rubbish bins near most tube stations, and none in the tube stationsat all. If you ask the station staff, the official answer is to throw it on the floor.</P>
 <P>And the dearth of rubbish bins on the streets means that there's a fair bit of rubbish on the streets - not s good look.</P>
 <P>Now, while I can understand this is providing gainful employment for many a street cleaner, and tube station cleaner, it still pisses me off.</P>
 <P>I know there was the IRA thing with bombs in rubbish bins, but that was quite a while ago. Now, of course, there's the whole al-queda thing, but as to how much of that is actually legit, and how much as scare-mongering, well...</P>
 <P>Anyway, <A href="http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/">Corporation of London</A>, and <A href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">Transport for London</A>, how about giving us some rubbish bins!</P>
 <P>&lt;/Rant&gt;</P>
