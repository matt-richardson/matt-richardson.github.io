<P>... that Australia lost that world cup game. I can understand when its hard fought, but when its won on a (very dodgy) penalty, right at the extreme end of the game - well, its just not cricket, really!</P>
 <P>I could be biased, but I reckon we played much better than Italy. Shame it doesn't work that way...</P>
 <P>Thems the breaks.</P>
