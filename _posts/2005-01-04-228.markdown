<P>Over Christmas, I wasn't the most well, but I'd pretty much recovered by New Years Eve.</P>
 <P>But, due to, ahem,&nbsp;an overindulgence on New Years Eve, my immune system has&nbsp;decided to check out what the weather in Majorca is like, and consequentially, left me without one.</P>
 <P>So, nowI'm coughing up all sorts of things that aren't supposed to be coughed up (lungs, diaphragms, horrible green stuff, and a golf ball, of all things).</P>
 <P>Just have to hang out for the doctors appointment on Thursday now (by which time, I'll be well, but...). You've got to love this country - the earliest appointment I could get was over a week in advance.</P>
 <P>I just felt that&nbsp;I had to inflict my whinging on you all. </P>
 <P>I'm going to go and sulk now, and suck my thumb.</P>
