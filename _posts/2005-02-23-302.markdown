<P><EM>[edit: added the pictures]</EM></P>
 <P>Got very excited yesterday - it snowed properly for the first time!</P>
 <P>Was at work when it first snowed, but that didn't count, cos I was stuck inside. But, went home, and when I got off the tube, it was snowing properly :). Such a cool thing - butI'm sure in a week or so, I'll be thoroughly annoyed at it. Got home, grabbed the camera, and headed back out to take some photos so you can share the excitement... :) It was so exciting - I felt like a kid. I'm sure anyone who saw me taking photos thought I was an absolute idiot, but who cares. Cath, one of my new housemates, had a bit of a laugh at me too... :)</P>
