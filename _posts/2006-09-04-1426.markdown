<p>I'm back in travel mode. currently in Berlin, after a week off work, where I bummed around, visited Cambridge with Rob and Dan, and dropped by Liverpool for Andrew and Caths wedding, which was quite good. Will post a photo or two when I can.</p>
 
 <p>Now on the road with Matt and Charlie for three weeks, heading south from Berlin, aiming to drop by Prague, Krakow, Vienna, and end up in Croatia. </p>
 
 <p>Should be fun! :)</p>
