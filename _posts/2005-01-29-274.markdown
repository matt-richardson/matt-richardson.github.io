<P>Just re-reading an email I'd sent to a friend, about going insane, getting fed up with looking for a contract:</P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>I'm going insane! Shoot me! </P>
 <P>I know. I'll shoot me (somewhere where its not going to hurt too much), then find a corrupt doctor to pronounce me dead, get the life insurance, and then&nbsp;I dont have to get a job! yay!</P>
 <P>Hmm... need to investigate plastic surgery and false passports...&nbsp; </P>
 <P>Note to self - tell family that I'm not dead.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>I'm worried about the way my brain works...</P>
