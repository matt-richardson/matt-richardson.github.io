<P>Ahh... Back in Melbourne again, just about to head out to dinner with the family. Just got back from Cairns, and just about to head off again tomorrow to New Zealand.</P>
 <P>Had a good time in Melbourne - caught up with a lot of people, which was definitely a good thing, but missed out on catching up with some that I really wanted to see - not the happiest about that. But, all in all, had a good time. Christmas was pretty good - wouldn't have been good in London by myself. New years eve was good too - ended up in the city, watched the fireworks, and generally partied the night away. Bit painful getting up and going to the airport on new years day though.</P>
 <P>Slightly odd the differences I'm noticing here. Realised that a lot of the plants and trees are a really dusty green compared to England. But, there's lots more of them around. Also really noticed that the sun really bites here as well - had forgotten that; ended up bright red within the first few days <IMG alt=:( class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-6.gif" border=0>. Really noticing the Aussie drawl too - quite scary sometimes. Everything here is so much more open as well - you can see so much more of the sky.</P>
 <P>Cairns was pretty good - was hot and humid though. Went diving on 2 days - 6 dives in all. Was pretty good - saw some reef sharks, some sea turtles, found Nemo <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0>, and lots of other cool stuff. Took a disposable camera with me - should have soon cool shots - will upload them when I get a chance. Also went on a 4WD trek through the tropical rainforest - was good. Also did a lot of relaxing and partying too. Was a good trip all up.</P>
 <P>I think that kinda brings everything up to date... More I've got to share (visa issues, future plans, other random thoughts), but I'll save them for later...</P>
 <P>Look out New Zealand - here I come!</P>
