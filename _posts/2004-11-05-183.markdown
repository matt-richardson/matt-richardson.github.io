<P><EM><STRONG>Warning</STRONG> - This is not a travel entry - its more a &#8220;get stuff of the brain&#8220; type of thing.</EM></P>
 <P>I'm currently back in Athens, for a brief stopover - all of 5 hours or so, between returning from Nafplio, and heading up to Meteora. The train out leaves about 4 minutes to midnight, so i dont think there'll be much sleep tonight. Journey takes about 6 hours, with a changeover half way through. Painful.</P>
 <P>Anyway, I just thought I'd take the time to put down a bit thats a <STRIKE>bit</STRIKE> lot deeper than usual.</P>
 <P>I'm not entirely sure, but i'm not enjoying the whole traveling thing that much at the moment. I think its due to a few reasons:</P>
 <UL>
 <LI>The hostels we've been staying in haven't really had the whole common room thing happening properly. Where they have had a proper common room, its been pretty crappy, and not really condusive to meeting people</LI>
 <LI>There's been very few kitchens to make dinner in.</LI>
 <LI>Amy is running on a budget thats a lot tighter than mine - so that sort of limits how often we eat out/go out for a few drinks</LI>
 <LI>It seems to be past the backpacking season here - there's relatively few people around.</LI>
 <LI>Amy and I are getting along fine - but we just dont have the&nbsp;connection that means we can sit there and talk about crap for hours. So, it means that i'm not quite getting the interaction that makes up a really good trip.</LI>
 <LI>I think i'm missing the structure that work forces on you... Aggghhh! i'm missing having a job. Not good.</LI>
 <LI>I'm missing having a home. A place that i can go back to and have my stuff all there, and setup and a proper bed, and proper meals...</LI></UL>
 <P>So, i'm not sure if this is coming out deep, or more just a whinge. Probably the second option i'm thinking, but who cares. Its my blog, so i can say what i want <IMG alt=:P class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-4.gif">.&nbsp; </P>
 <P>By the look of it, when i get back to london, i'll try and find a place to live, and look for a job. Gonna be painful (especially with the whole making new friends thing), but i'll get there. I think i'll pass on the travelling for a while, and see how it goes. Get myself back into normal society for a while.</P>
 <P>Anyway, thats enough of a ramble for now - feel free to drop me an email...<IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif"></P>
