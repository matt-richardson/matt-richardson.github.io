<P>A <A href="http://www.oneroundpebble.com/paulsblog">mate</A> took this photo for me - I'd seen it when I was in Melbourne last time round, but didn't get a chance to take it myself.</P>

 <P>I was quite annoyed when I saw this, as its simply not true. How can what I ate for breakfast help fight terrorists? How can what colour socks I'm wearing be vital to national security? Its just adding to the climate of fear, and&nbsp;getting people used to the idea that the government should&nbsp;know absolutely everything about&nbsp;us... So much for privacy.</P>
