<P>Sue crashed at my place over the weekend, and then was heading over to Otto's place for the rest of the week. Otto's a Finnish friend that she knew from a while back.</P>
 <P>Was talking to Sue the night before she headed over, and gave her my business card. She did a double take at the company name -&nbsp;turned out that Otto works at <A href="http://www.mergermarket.com">mergermarket</A> as well!</P>
 <P>Out of all the people in London, she's going to stay at one of my colleagues houses. Freaky! <IMG alt=":)" class="emoticon" src="/images/emotions/emotion-1.gif" border=0></P>
